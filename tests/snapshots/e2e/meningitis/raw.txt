==Signs and symptoms==

===Clinical features===
[[File:Neck stiffness.jpg|thumb|right|Neck stiffness, Texas meningitis epidemic of 1911–12]]
In adults, the most common symptom of meningitis is a severe [[headache]], occurring in almost 90% of cases of bacterial meningitis, followed by neck stiffness (the inability to flex the neck forward passively due to increased neck [[muscle tone]] and stiffness).<ref name="vdBeek2004">{{Cite journal |vauthors=van de Beek D, de Gans J, Spanjaard L, Weisfelt M, Reitsma JB, Vermeulen M |date=October 2004 |title=Clinical features and prognostic factors in adults with bacterial meningitis |url=https://pure.uva.nl/ws/files/4089960/45119_204449y.pdf |url-status=live |journal=The New England Journal of Medicine |volume=351 |issue=18 |pages=1849–59 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa040845 |pmid=15509818 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200803222631/https://pure.uva.nl/ws/files/4089960/45119_204449y.pdf |archive-date=3 August 2020 |access-date=30 December 2018 |s2cid=22287169}}</ref> The classic triad of diagnostic signs consists of neck stiffness, sudden [[Fever#Types|high fever]], and [[altered level of consciousness|altered mental status]]; however, all three features are present in only 44–46% of bacterial meningitis cases.<ref name=vdBeek2004/><ref name="Attia">{{Cite journal |vauthors=Attia J, Hatala R, Cook DJ, Wong JG |date=July 1999 |title=The rational clinical examination.

Small children often do not exhibit the aforementioned symptoms, and may only be [[irritability|irritable]] and look unwell.<ref name=Lancet/> The [[fontanelle]] (the soft spot on the top of a baby's head) can bulge in infants aged up to 6&nbsp;months. Other features that distinguish meningitis from less severe illnesses in young children are leg pain, cold extremities, and an abnormal [[Human skin color|skin color]].<ref name="SIGN">{{Cite journal |vauthors=Theilen U, Wilson L, Wilson G, Beattie JO, Qureshi S, Simpson D |date=June 2008 |title=Management of invasive meningococcal disease in children and young people: summary of SIGN guidelines |journal=BMJ |volume=336 |issue=7657 |pages=1367–70 |doi=10.1136/bmj.a129 |pmc=2427067 |pmid=18556318}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |url=http://www.sign.ac.uk/pdf/sign102.pdf |title=Management of invasive meningococcal disease in children and young people |date=May 2008 |publisher=Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) |isbn=978-1-905813-31-5 |location=Edinburgh |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140709111421/http://www.sign.ac.uk/pdf/sign102.pdf |archive-date=9 July 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Neck stiffness occurs in 70% of bacterial meningitis in adults.<ref name=Attia/> Other signs include the presence of positive [[Kernig's sign]] or [[Brudziński sign]]. Kernig's sign is assessed with the person lying [[Supine position|supine]], with the hip and knee flexed to 90&nbsp;degrees. In a person with a positive Kernig's sign, pain limits passive extension of the knee. A positive Brudzinski's sign occurs when flexion of the neck causes involuntary flexion of the knee and hip. Although Kernig's sign and Brudzinski's sign are both commonly used to screen for meningitis, the [[Sensitivity and specificity|sensitivity]] of these tests is limited.<ref name=Attia/><ref name="Thomas_2002">{{Cite journal |vauthors=Thomas KE, Hasbun R, Jekel J, Quagliarello VJ |date=July 2002 |title=The diagnostic accuracy of Kernig's sign, Brudzinski's sign, and nuchal rigidity in adults with suspected meningitis |journal=Clinical Infectious Diseases |volume=35 |issue=1 |pages=46–52 |doi=10.1086/340979 |pmid=12060874 |s2cid=3196834 | doi-access=free | title-link=doi }}</ref> They do, however, have very good [[Sensitivity and specificity|specificity]] for meningitis: the signs rarely occur in other diseases.<ref name=Attia/> Another test, known as the "jolt accentuation maneuver" helps determine whether meningitis is present in those reporting fever and headache. A person is asked to rapidly rotate the head horizontally; if this does not make the headache worse, meningitis is unlikely.<ref name=Attia/>

Other problems can produce symptoms similar to those above, but from non-meningitic causes. This is called [[meningism]] or pseudomeningitis.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Meningitis |url=https://www.who.int/health-topics/meningitis |access-date=25 April 2022 |publisher=[[World Health Organization]] (WHO) |archive-date=25 April 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220425134428/https://www.who.int/health-topics/meningitis |url-status=live }}</ref>

Meningitis caused by the bacterium ''[[Neisseria meningitidis]]'' (known as "meningococcal meningitis") can be differentiated from meningitis with other causes by a rapidly spreading [[petechial rash]], which may precede other symptoms.<ref name=SIGN/> The rash consists of numerous small, irregular purple or red spots ("petechiae") on the trunk, [[Human leg|lower extremities]], mucous membranes, conjunctiva, and (occasionally) the palms of the hands or soles of the feet. The rash is typically [[non-blanching rash|non-blanching]]; the redness does not disappear when pressed with a finger or a glass tumbler. Although this rash is not necessarily present in meningococcal meningitis, it is relatively specific for the disease; it does, however, occasionally occur in meningitis due to other bacteria.<ref name=Lancet/> Other clues on the cause of meningitis may be the skin signs of [[hand, foot and mouth disease]] and [[genital herpes]], both of which are associated with various forms of viral meningitis.<ref name="LoganMacMahon">{{Cite journal |vauthors=Logan SA, MacMahon E |date=January 2008 |title=Viral meningitis |journal=BMJ |volume=336 |issue=7634 |pages=36–40 |doi=10.1136/bmj.39409.673657.AE |pmc=2174764 |pmid=18174598}}</ref>

===Early complications===
[[File:Charlotte Cleverley-Bisman Meningicoccal Disease.jpg|thumb|[[Charlotte Cleverley-Bisman]] developed severe meningococcal meningitis as a young child; in her case, the petechial rash progressed to [[gangrene]] and required [[amputation]] of all limbs. She survived the disease and became a [[poster child]] for a meningitis vaccination campaign in [[New Zealand]].]]
Additional problems may occur in the early stage of the illness. These may require specific treatment, and sometimes indicate severe illness or worse prognosis. The infection may trigger [[sepsis]], a [[systemic inflammatory response syndrome]] of falling [[blood pressure]], [[tachycardia|fast heart rate]], high or abnormally low temperature, and [[tachypnea|rapid breathing]]. Very low blood pressure may occur at an early stage, especially but not exclusively in meningococcal meningitis; this may lead to insufficient blood supply to other organs.<ref name=Lancet/> [[Disseminated intravascular coagulation]], the excessive activation of [[coagulation|blood clotting]], may obstruct [[blood flow]] to organs and paradoxically increase the bleeding risk. [[Gangrene]] of limbs can occur in [[meningococcal disease]].<ref name=Lancet/> Severe meningococcal and pneumococcal infections may result in hemorrhaging of the [[adrenal gland]]s, leading to [[Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome]], which is often fatal.<ref name="pmid9696186">{{Cite journal |vauthors=Varon J, Chen K, Sternbach GL |year=1998 |title=Rupert Waterhouse and Carl Friderichsen: adrenal apoplexy |journal=The Journal of Emergency Medicine |volume=16 |issue=4 |pages=643–47 |doi=10.1016/S0736-4679(98)00061-4 |pmid=9696186}}</ref>

The [[cerebral edema|brain tissue may swell]], [[intracranial pressure|pressure inside the skull]] may increase and the swollen brain may [[Brain herniation|herniate]] through the skull base. This may be noticed by a decreasing [[level of consciousness]], loss of the [[pupillary light reflex]], and [[abnormal posturing]].<ref name=NEJM/> The inflammation of the brain tissue may also obstruct the normal flow of CSF around the brain ([[hydrocephalus]]).<ref name=NEJM/> [[Seizure]]s may occur for various reasons; in children, seizures are common in the early stages of meningitis (in 30% of cases) and do not necessarily indicate an underlying cause.<ref name=IDSA/> Seizures may result from increased pressure and from areas of inflammation in the brain tissue.<ref name=NEJM/> [[Focal seizures]] (seizures that involve one limb or part of the body), persistent seizures, late-onset seizures and those that are difficult to control with medication indicate a poorer long-term outcome.<ref name=Lancet/>

Inflammation of the meninges may lead to abnormalities of the [[cranial nerves]], a group of nerves arising from the [[brain stem]] that supply the head and neck area and which control, among other functions, eye movement, facial muscles, and hearing.<ref name=Lancet/><ref name=Attia/> Visual symptoms and [[hearing loss]] may persist after an episode of meningitis.<ref name=Lancet/> Inflammation of the brain ([[encephalitis]]) or its [[blood vessel]]s ([[cerebral vasculitis]]), as well as the formation of [[thrombosis|blood clots]] in the veins ([[cerebral venous sinus thrombosis|cerebral venous thrombosis]]), may all lead to weakness, loss of sensation, or abnormal movement or function of the part of the body supplied by the affected area of the brain.<ref name=Lancet/><ref name=NEJM/>

==Causes==
Meningitis is typically caused by an [[infection]]. Most infections are due to [[virus]]es, and others due to [[Pathogenic bacteria|bacteria]], [[Pathogenic fungus|fungi]], and [[parasitism|parasites]].<ref name=WHO2023/> Mostly the parasites are [[parasitic worm]]s,<ref name=Ginsberg/> but can also rarely include [[Parasitism|parasitic]] [[Amoeba (genus)|amoebae]].<ref name="CDC2022">{{cite web |title=Amebic Meningitis |url=https://www.cdc.gov/meningitis/amebic.html |publisher=U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) |date=12 August 2022 |access-date=31 May 2023 |archive-date=24 May 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230524200711/https://www.cdc.gov/meningitis/amebic.html |url-status=live }}</ref> Meningitis may also result from various non-infectious causes.<ref name= Ginsberg/> The term ''[[aseptic meningitis]]'' refers to cases of meningitis in which no bacterial infection can be demonstrated. This type of meningitis is usually caused by viruses, but it may be due to bacterial infection that has already been partially treated, when bacteria disappear from the meninges, or when pathogens infect a space adjacent to the meninges (such as [[sinusitis]]). [[Endocarditis]] (an infection of the [[heart valve]]s which spreads small clusters of bacteria through the bloodstream) may cause aseptic meningitis. Aseptic meningitis may also result from infection with [[spirochete]]s, a group of bacteria that includes ''[[Treponema pallidum]]'' (the cause of [[syphilis]]) and ''[[Borrelia burgdorferi]]'' (known for causing [[Lyme disease]]), and may also result from [[cerebral malaria]] (malaria infecting the brain).<ref name= Ginsberg/>

===Bacterial===

The types of bacteria that cause bacterial meningitis vary according to the infected individual's age group.

* In [[premature birth|premature babies]] and [[infant|newborns]] up to three months old, common causes are ''[[group B streptococcus|group B streptococci]]'' (subtypes III which normally inhabit the [[vagina]] and are mainly a cause during the first week of life) and bacteria that normally inhabit the [[Gastrointestinal tract|digestive tract]] such as ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' (carrying the K1 antigen).

A [[head injury]] potentially allows nasal cavity bacteria to enter the meningeal space. Similarly, devices in the brain and meninges, such as [[cerebral shunt]]s, [[extraventricular drain]]s or [[Ommaya reservoir]]s, carry an increased risk of meningitis.

==Mechanism==
The meninges comprise three membranes that, together with the [[cerebrospinal fluid]], enclose and protect the [[brain]] and [[spinal cord]] (the [[central nervous system]]). The [[pia mater]] is a delicate impermeable membrane that firmly adheres to the surface of the brain, following all the minor contours. The [[arachnoid mater]] (so named because of its spider-web-like appearance) is a loosely fitting sac on top of the pia mater. The [[subarachnoid space]] separates the arachnoid and pia mater membranes and is filled with cerebrospinal fluid. The outermost membrane, the [[dura mater]], is a thick durable membrane, which is attached to both the arachnoid membrane and the skull.

In bacterial meningitis, bacteria reach the meninges by one of two main routes: through the bloodstream (hematogenous spread) or through direct contact between the meninges and either the nasal cavity or the skin. In most cases, meningitis follows invasion of the bloodstream by organisms that live on [[mucous membrane|mucosal surfaces]] such as the [[nasal cavity]]. This is often in turn preceded by viral infections, which break down the normal barrier provided by the mucosal surfaces. Once bacteria have entered the bloodstream, they enter the [[subarachnoid space]] in places where the [[blood–brain barrier]] is vulnerable&nbsp;– such as the [[choroid plexus]]. Meningitis occurs in 25% of newborns with bloodstream infections due to [[group B streptococci]]; this phenomenon is much less common in adults.<ref name=Lancet/> Direct contamination of the cerebrospinal fluid may arise from indwelling devices, skull fractures, or infections of the nasopharynx or the nasal sinuses that have formed a tract with the subarachnoid space (see above); occasionally, [[Congenital disorder|congenital defects]] of the [[dura mater]] can be identified.<ref name=Lancet/>

The large-scale [[inflammation]] that occurs in the subarachnoid space during meningitis is not a direct result of bacterial infection but can rather largely be attributed to the response of the [[immune system]] to the entry of bacteria into the [[central nervous system]]. When components of the bacterial [[cell membrane]] are identified by the immune cells of the brain ([[astrocyte]]s and [[microglia]]), they respond by releasing large amounts of [[cytokine]]s, hormone-like mediators that recruit other immune cells and stimulate other tissues to participate in an immune response. The blood–brain barrier becomes more permeable, leading to [[Cerebral edema#Vasogenic|"vasogenic" cerebral edema]] (swelling of the brain due to fluid leakage from blood vessels). Large numbers of [[white blood cell]]s enter the CSF, causing inflammation of the meninges and leading to [[Cerebral edema#Interstitial Cerebral Edema|"interstitial" edema]] (swelling due to fluid between the cells). In addition, the walls of the blood vessels themselves become inflamed (cerebral vasculitis), which leads to decreased blood flow and a third type of edema, [[Cerebral edema#Cytotoxic|"cytotoxic" edema]]. The three forms of cerebral edema all lead to increased [[intracranial pressure]]; together with the lowered blood pressure often encountered in [[sepsis]], this means that it is harder for blood to enter the brain; consequently [[brain cell]]s are deprived of oxygen and undergo [[apoptosis]] ([[programmed cell death]]).<ref name=Lancet/>

Administration of antibiotics may initially worsen the process outlined above, by increasing the amount of bacterial cell membrane products released through the destruction of bacteria. Particular treatments, such as the use of [[glucocorticoid|corticosteroids]], are aimed at dampening the immune system's response to this phenomenon.<ref name=Lancet/><ref name=NEJM/>

A diagnostic and therapeutic difficulty is "partially treated meningitis", where there are meningitis symptoms after receiving antibiotics (such as for presumptive [[sinusitis]]).

==Prevention==
For some causes of meningitis, protection can be provided in the long term through [[vaccination]], or in the short term with [[antibiotic]]s. Some behavioral measures may also be effective.

===Behavioral===
Bacterial and viral meningitis are contagious, but neither is as contagious as the [[common cold]] or [[flu]].<ref name="CDCtransmission">{{Cite web |date=7 February 2022|title=Causes and How It Spreads |url=https://www.cdc.gov/meningococcal/about/causes-transmission.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629041733/http://www.cdc.gov/meningitis/about/transmission.html |archive-date=29 June 2011 |access-date=18 June 2011 |publisher=U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC)}}</ref> Both can be transmitted through droplets of respiratory secretions during close contact such as kissing, sneezing or coughing on someone,<ref name="CDCtransmission" /> but bacterial meningitis cannot be spread by only breathing the air where a person with meningitis has been. Viral meningitis is typically caused by [[enteroviruses]], and is most commonly spread through fecal contamination.<ref name="CDCtransmission" /> The risk of infection can be decreased by changing the behavior that led to transmission.

===Vaccination===
Since the 1980s, many countries have included [[Hib vaccine|immunization against ''Haemophilus influenzae'' type B]] in their routine childhood vaccination schemes.

===Antibiotics===
Short-term antibiotic prophylaxis is another method of prevention, particularly of meningococcal meningitis. In cases of meningococcal meningitis, preventative treatment in close contacts with antibiotics (e.g. [[rifampicin]], [[ciprofloxacin]] or [[ceftriaxone]]) can reduce their risk of contracting the condition, but does not protect against future infections.<ref name=EFNS/><ref name="Zal2013">{{Cite journal |vauthors=Zalmanovici Trestioreanu A, Fraser A, Gafter-Gvili A, Paul M, Leibovici L |date=October 2013 |title=Antibiotics for preventing meningococcal infections |journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |volume=10 |issue=10 |pages=CD004785 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004785.pub5 |pmc=6698485 |pmid=24163051}}</ref> Resistance to rifampicin has been noted to increase after use, which has caused some to recommend considering other agents.<ref name=Zal2013/> While antibiotics are frequently used in an attempt to prevent meningitis in those with a [[basilar skull fracture]] there is not enough evidence to determine whether this is beneficial or harmful.<ref name="CochSk2015">{{Cite journal |vauthors=Ratilal BO, Costa J, Pappamikail L, Sampaio C |date=April 2015 |title=Antibiotic prophylaxis for preventing meningitis in patients with basilar skull fractures |journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |volume=4 |issue=4 |pages=CD004884 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004884.pub4 |pmid=25918919}}</ref> This applies to those with or without a CSF leak.<ref name=CochSk2015/>

===Bacterial meningitis===

====Antibiotics====
[[File:Ceftriaxone structure.png|thumb|Structural formula of ceftriaxone, one of the third-generation cefalosporin antibiotics recommended for the initial treatment of bacterial meningitis.]]

[[Empiric antibiotics]] (treatment without exact diagnosis) should be started immediately, even before the results of the lumbar puncture and CSF analysis are known. The choice of initial treatment depends largely on the kind of bacteria that cause meningitis in a particular place and population. For instance, in the United Kingdom, empirical treatment consists of a third-generation [[cefalosporin]] such as [[cefotaxime]] or [[ceftriaxone]].<ref name=EFNS/><ref name=BIS/> In the US, where resistance to cefalosporins is increasingly found in streptococci, addition of [[vancomycin]] to the initial treatment is recommended.<ref name=NEJM/><ref name=IDSA/><ref name=EFNS/> [[Chloramphenicol]], either alone or in combination with [[ampicillin]], however, appears to work equally well.<ref>{{Cite journal |vauthors=Prasad K, Kumar A, Gupta PK, Singhal T |date=October 2007 |veditors=Prasad K |title=Third generation cephalosporins versus conventional antibiotics for treating acute bacterial meningitis |journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |volume=2007 |issue=4 |pages=CD001832 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001832.pub3 |pmc=8078560 |pmid=17943757}}</ref>

Empirical therapy may be chosen on the basis of the person's age, whether the infection was preceded by a [[head injury]], whether the person has undergone recent [[neurosurgery]] and whether or not a cerebral shunt is present.<ref name=IDSA/> In young children and those over 50&nbsp;years of age, as well as those who are immunocompromised, the addition of [[ampicillin]] is recommended to cover ''[[Listeria monocytogenes]]''.<ref name=IDSA/><ref name=EFNS/> Once the Gram stain results become available, and the broad type of bacterial cause is known, it may be possible to change the antibiotics to those likely to deal with the presumed group of pathogens.<ref name=IDSA/> The results of the CSF [[microbiological culture|culture]] generally take longer to become available (24–48 hours). Once they do, empiric therapy may be switched to specific antibiotic therapy targeted to the specific causative organism and its sensitivities to antibiotics.<ref name=IDSA/> For an antibiotic to be effective in meningitis it must not only be active against the pathogenic bacterium but also reach the meninges in adequate quantities; some antibiotics have inadequate penetrance and therefore have little use in meningitis. Most of the antibiotics used in meningitis have not been tested directly on people with meningitis in [[clinical trial]]s. Rather, the relevant knowledge has mostly derived from laboratory studies in [[rabbit]]s.<ref name=IDSA/> Tuberculous meningitis requires prolonged treatment with antibiotics. While tuberculosis of the lungs is typically treated for six months, those with tuberculous meningitis are typically treated for a year or longer.<ref name=Tuberc/>

==== Fluid Therapy ====
Fluid given intravenously are an essential part of treatment of bacterial meningitis. There is no difference in terms of mortality or acute severe neurological complications in children given a maintenance regimen over restricted-fluid regimen, but evidence is in favor of the maintenance regimen in terms of emergence of chronic severe neurological complications.<ref>{{Cite journal |vauthors = Maconochie IK, Bhaumik S |date=November 2016 |title=Fluid therapy for acute bacterial meningitis |journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |volume=2016 |issue=11 |pages=CD004786 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004786.pub5 |issn=1469-493X |pmc=6464853 |pmid=27813057}}</ref>

====Steroids====

Professional guidelines therefore recommend the commencement of dexamethasone or a similar corticosteroid just before the first dose of antibiotics is given, and continued for four&nbsp;days.<ref name=EFNS/><ref name=BIS/> Given that most of the benefit of the treatment is confined to those with pneumococcal meningitis, some guidelines suggest that dexamethasone be discontinued if another cause for meningitis is identified.<ref name=IDSA/><ref name=EFNS/> The likely mechanism is suppression of overactive inflammation.<ref name="deGans2002">{{Cite journal |vauthors=de Gans J, van de Beek D |date=November 2002 |title=Dexamethasone in adults with bacterial meningitis |url=http://dare.uva.nl/personal/pure/en/publications/dexamethasone-in-adults-with-bacterial-meningitis(72435a94-1ea1-488f-9407-345b79b068cc).html |url-status=live |journal=The New England Journal of Medicine |volume=347 |issue=20 |pages=1549–56 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa021334 |pmid=12432041 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210829150418/https://dare.uva.nl/search?identifier=72435a94-1ea1-488f-9407-345b79b068cc |archive-date=29 August 2021 |access-date=20 October 2018 |s2cid=72596402| doi-access=free | title-link=doi }}</ref>

Additional treatment with corticosteroids have a different role in children than in adults. Though the benefit of corticosteroids has been demonstrated in adults as well as in children from high-income countries, their use in children from [[Poverty|low-income]] countries is not supported by the evidence; the reason for this discrepancy is not clear.<ref name=CochDex2013/> Even in high-income countries, the benefit of corticosteroids is only seen when they are given prior to the first dose of antibiotics, and is greatest in cases of ''H. influenzae'' meningitis,<ref name=IDSA/><ref name="pmid9302246">{{Cite journal |vauthors=McIntyre PB, Berkey CS, King SM, Schaad UB, Kilpi T, Kanra GY, Perez CM | display-authors = 6 |date=September 1997 |title=Dexamethasone as adjunctive therapy in bacterial meningitis.

Thus, corticosteroids are recommended in the treatment of pediatric meningitis if the cause is ''H. influenzae'', and only if given prior to the first dose of antibiotics; other uses are controversial.<ref name=IDSA/>

==== Adjuvant therapies ====
In addition to the primary therapy of antibiotics and corticosteroids, other adjuvant therapies are under development or are sometimes used to try and improve survival from bacterial meningitis and reduce the risk of neurological problems. Examples of adjuvant therapies that have been trialed include [[Paracetamol|acetaminophe]]<nowiki/>n, [[immunoglobulin therapy]], [[heparin]], [[Pentoxifylline|pentoxifyline]], and a mononucleotide mixture with [[succinic acid]].<ref name=":2">{{Cite journal |vauthors = Fisher J, Linder A, Calevo MG, Bentzer P |date=November 2021 |title=Non-corticosteroid adjuvant therapies for acute bacterial meningitis |url= |journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |volume=2021 |issue=11 |pages=CD013437 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD013437.pub2 |issn=1469-493X |pmc=8610076 |pmid=34813078}}</ref> It is not clear if any of these therapies are helpful or worsen outcomes in people with acute bacterial meningitis.<ref name=":2" />

===Viral meningitis===
[[Viral meningitis]] typically only requires supportive therapy; most viruses responsible for causing meningitis are not amenable to specific treatment. Viral meningitis tends to run a more benign course than bacterial meningitis. [[Herpes simplex virus]] and [[varicella zoster virus]] may respond to treatment with antiviral drugs such as [[aciclovir]], but there are no clinical trials that have specifically addressed whether this treatment is effective.<ref name=LoganMacMahon/> Mild cases of viral meningitis can be treated at home with conservative measures such as fluid, bedrest, and analgesics.<ref>{{Cite web |date=11 December 2007 |title=Meningitis and Encephalitis Fact Sheet |url=http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/encephalitis_meningitis/detail_encephalitis_meningitis.htm |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140104212119/http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/encephalitis_meningitis/detail_encephalitis_meningitis.htm |archive-date=4 January 2014 |access-date=27 April 2009 |publisher=National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS)}}</ref>

Untreated, bacterial meningitis is almost always fatal. According to the WHO bacterial meningitis has an overall mortality rate of 16.7% (with treatment).<ref name=WHO2023>{{Cite web |title=Meningitis |url=https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/meningitis |access-date=30 May 2023 |publisher=[[World Health Organization]] (WHO) |archive-date=10 January 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220110173749/https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/meningitis |url-status=live }}</ref> Viral meningitis, in contrast, tends to resolve spontaneously and is rarely fatal. With treatment, [[Mortality rate|mortality]] (risk of death) from bacterial meningitis depends on the age of the person and the underlying cause. Of newborns, 20–30% may die from an episode of bacterial meningitis. This risk is much lower in older children, whose mortality is about 2%, but rises again to about 19–37% in adults.<ref name=Lancet/><ref name=NEJM/>

Risk of death is predicted by various factors apart from age, such as the pathogen and the time it takes for the pathogen to be cleared from the cerebrospinal fluid,<ref name=Lancet/> the severity of the generalized illness, a decreased level of consciousness or an abnormally low count of white blood cells in the CSF.<ref name=NEJM/> Meningitis caused by ''H.&nbsp;influenzae'' and meningococci has a better prognosis than cases caused by group B streptococci, coliforms and ''S. pneumoniae''.<ref name=Lancet/> In adults, too, meningococcal meningitis has a lower mortality (3–7%) than pneumococcal disease.<ref name=NEJM/>

In children there are several potential disabilities which may result from damage to the nervous system, including [[sensorineural hearing loss]], [[epilepsy]], [[Learning disability|learning]] and behavioral difficulties, as well as [[Intellectual disability|decreased intelligence]].<ref name=Lancet/> These occur in about 15% of survivors.<ref name=Lancet/> Some of the hearing loss may be reversible.<ref name="pmid9068303">{{Cite journal |vauthors=Richardson MP, Reid A, Tarlow MJ, Rudd PT |date=February 1997 |title=Hearing loss during bacterial meningitis |journal=Archives of Disease in Childhood |volume=76 |issue=2 |pages=134–38 |doi=10.1136/adc.76.2.134 |pmc=1717058 |pmid=9068303 }}</ref> In adults, 66% of all cases emerge without disability.

Bacterial meningitis occurs in about 3 people per 100,000 annually in [[Western world|Western countries]]. Population-wide studies have shown that viral meningitis is more common, at 10.9 per 100,000, and occurs more often in the summer. In Brazil, the rate of bacterial meningitis is higher, at 45.8 per 100,000 annually.<ref name=Attia/> [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] has been plagued by large epidemics of meningococcal meningitis for over a century,<ref>{{Cite journal |vauthors=Lapeyssonnie L |year=1963 |title=Cerebrospinal Meningitis in Africa |journal=Bulletin of the World Health Organization |volume=28 Suppl |issue=Suppl |pages=1–114 |pmc=2554630 |pmid=14259333}}</ref> leading to it being labeled the "meningitis belt".

Meningococcal disease occurs in epidemics in areas where many people live together for the first time, such as army barracks during mobilization, university and college campuses<ref name=Lancet/> and the annual [[Hajj]] pilgrimage.<ref name="WilderSmith">{{Cite journal |vauthors=Wilder-Smith A |date=October 2007 |title=Meningococcal vaccine in travelers |journal=Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases |volume=20 |issue=5 |pages=454–60 |doi=10.1097/QCO.0b013e3282a64700 |pmid=17762777 |s2cid=9411482}}</ref> Although the pattern of epidemic cycles in Africa is not well understood, several factors have been associated with the development of epidemics in the meningitis belt. They include: medical conditions (immunological susceptibility of the population), demographic conditions (travel and large population displacements), socioeconomic conditions (overcrowding and poor living conditions), climatic conditions (drought and dust storms), and concurrent infections (acute respiratory infections).<ref name=WHO1998/>

There are significant differences in the local distribution of causes for bacterial meningitis. For instance, while ''N. meningitides'' groups B and C cause most disease episodes in Europe, group A is found in Asia and continues to predominate in Africa, where it causes most of the major epidemics in the meningitis belt, accounting for about 80% to 85% of documented meningococcal meningitis cases.<ref name=WHO1998/>

==History==
Some suggest that [[Hippocrates]] may have realized the existence of meningitis,<ref name=Attia/> and it seems that [[meningism]] was known to pre-Renaissance physicians such as [[Avicenna]].<ref name="Walker">{{Cite book |last1=Walker |first1=Arthur Earl |title=The Genesis of Neuroscience |last2=Laws |first2=Edward R. |last3=Udvarhelyi |first3=George B. |publisher=Thieme |year=1998 |isbn=978-1-879284-62-3 |pages=219–21 |chapter=Infections and inflammatory involvement of the CNS |access-date=24 August 2020 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UaSaRzw8gYEC&pg=PP1 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220304053043/https://books.google.com/books?id=UaSaRzw8gYEC&pg=PP1 |archive-date=4 March 2022 |url-status=live |name-list-style=vanc}}</ref> The description of tuberculous meningitis, then called "[[dropsy]] in the brain", is often attributed to Edinburgh physician [[Robert Whytt|Sir Robert Whytt]] in a posthumous report that appeared in 1768, although the link with tuberculosis and its pathogen was not made until the next century.<ref name=Walker/><ref>{{Cite book |vauthors=Whytt R |title=Observations on the Dropsy in the Brain |publisher=J.

The first report of bacterial infection underlying meningitis was by the Austrian bacteriologist [[Anton Weichselbaum]], who in 1887 described the ''meningococcus''.<ref>{{Cite journal |vauthors=Weichselbaum A |year=1887 |title=Ueber die Aetiologie der akuten Meningitis cerebro-spinalis |journal=Fortschrift der Medizin |language=de |volume=5 |pages=573–83}}</ref> Mortality from meningitis was very high (over 90%) in early reports.
