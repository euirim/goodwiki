After writing in different forms throughout the 1880s, he became one of the most popular playwrights in London in the early 1890s. He is best remembered for his [[epigrams]] and plays, his novel ''[[The Picture of Dorian Gray]]'', and the circumstances of his criminal conviction for [[gross indecency]] for consensual homosexual acts in "one of the first celebrity trials",<ref name="Trials">{{cite news |last=Field |first=Marcus |title=Is Oscar Wilde's reputation due for another reassessment? |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre-dance/features/oscar-wilde-facing-retrial-9773718.html |url-status=live |work=[[The Independent]] |date=4 October 2014 |access-date=16 March 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210302134040/https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre-dance/features/oscar-wilde-facing-retrial-9773718.html |archive-date=2 March 2021}}</ref> imprisonment, and early death from [[meningitis]] at the age of 46.

Wilde's parents were [[Anglo-Irish]] intellectuals in [[Dublin]]. In his youth Wilde learned to speak fluent French and German. At university, he read [[Literae Humaniores#Greats|Greats]]; he demonstrated himself to be an exceptional [[classicist]], first at [[Trinity College Dublin]], then at [[Magdalen College, Oxford]]. He became associated with the emerging philosophy of [[aestheticism]], led by two of his tutors, [[Walter Pater]] and [[John Ruskin]]. After university, Wilde moved to London into fashionable cultural and social circles.

As a spokesman for [[aestheticism]], he tried his hand at various literary activities: he published a book of poems, lectured in the United States and Canada on the new "English Renaissance in Art" and interior decoration, and then returned to London where he worked prolifically as a journalist. Known for his biting wit, flamboyant dress and glittering conversational skill, Wilde became one of the best-known personalities of his day. At the turn of the 1890s he refined his ideas about the supremacy of art in a series of dialogues and essays, and incorporated themes of decadence, duplicity, and beauty into what would be his only novel, ''The Picture of Dorian Gray'' (1890). The opportunity to construct aesthetic details precisely, and combine them with larger social themes, drew Wilde to write drama. He wrote ''[[Salome (play)|Salome]]'' (1891) in French while in Paris, but it was refused a licence for England due to an absolute prohibition on the portrayal of Biblical subjects on the English stage. Undiscouraged, Wilde produced four society comedies in the early 1890s, which made him one of the most successful playwrights of late-Victorian London.

At the height of his fame and success, while ''[[The Importance of Being Earnest]]'' (1895) was still being performed in London, Wilde prosecuted the [[John Douglas, 9th Marquess of Queensberry|Marquess of Queensberry]] for [[Defamation|criminal libel]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Bristow |first=Joseph |date=2016 |title=The blackmailer and the sodomite: Oscar Wilde on trial |url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1464700115620860 |journal=Feminist Theory |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=41–62 |doi=10.1177/1464700115620860 |s2cid=147294685 |issn=1464-7001}}</ref> The Marquess was the father of Wilde's lover, [[Lord Alfred Douglas]].

On his release, he left immediately for France, and never returned to Ireland or Britain. There he wrote his last work, ''[[The Ballad of Reading Gaol]]'' (1898), a long poem commemorating the harsh rhythms of prison life.

== Early life ==
[[File:Wilde Family home on Merrion Square.jpg|thumb|The Wilde family home on Merrion Square|left]]
Oscar Wilde was born at 21 [[Westland Row]], Dublin (now home of the [[Oscar Wilde Centre]], Trinity College), the second of three children born to an Anglo-Irish couple: [[Jane Wilde|Jane, née Elgee]], and [[Sir William Wilde]]. Oscar was two years younger than his brother, [[Willie Wilde|William (Willie) Wilde]].

Jane Wilde was a niece (by marriage) of the novelist, playwright and clergyman [[Charles Maturin]] (1780–1824), who may have influenced her own literary career. She believed, mistakenly, that she was of Italian ancestry,<ref>{{cite book |last=Sturgis |first=Matthew |author-link=Matthew Sturgis |year=2019 |orig-year=2018 |title=Oscar: A Life |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2FNNDwAAQBAJ&pg=PP26 |location=London |publisher=Head of Zeus |page=9 |isbn=9781788545983 |quote=Jane had also convinced herself that the Elgee name derived from the Italian 'Algiati' – and from this (imaginary) connection she was happy to make the short leap to claiming kinship with [[Dante]] Alighieri (in fact the Elgees descended from a long line of Durham labourers). |access-date=28 June 2022}}</ref> and under the pseudonym ''"Speranza"'' (the Italian word for 'hope'), she wrote poetry for the revolutionary [[Young Irelanders]] in 1848; she was a lifelong [[Irish nationalism|Irish nationalist]].<ref name="Parents">{{cite web |date=25 January 2001 |title=Literary Encyclopedia – Oscar Wilde |url=http://www.litencyc.com/php/speople.php?rec=true&UID=4718 |access-date=3 April 2009 |publisher=Litencyc.com |archive-date=3 April 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190403104444/https://www.litencyc.com/php/speople.php?rec=true&UID=4718 |url-status=live}}</ref> Jane Wilde read the Young Irelanders' poetry to Oscar and Willie, inculcating a love of these poets in her sons.{{sfn|Sandulescu|1994|p=53}} Her interest in the neo-classical revival showed in the paintings and busts of ancient Greece and Rome in her home.{{sfn|Sandulescu|1994|p=53}}

Sir William Wilde was Ireland's leading [[otology|oto]]-[[ophthalmology|ophthalmologic]] (ear and eye) surgeon and was knighted in 1864 for his services as medical adviser and assistant commissioner to the censuses of Ireland.<ref name="odnbwilliam">{{cite book |last=McGeachie |first=James |title=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |title-link=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=2004 |location=Oxford |chapter=Wilde, Sir William Robert Wills (1815–1876)}}</ref> He also wrote books about Irish archaeology and peasant folklore. A renowned philanthropist, his dispensary for the care of the city's poor at the rear of [[Trinity College, Dublin]] (TCD), was the forerunner of the Dublin Eye and Ear Hospital, now located at Adelaide Road.<ref name="odnbwilliam" /> On his father's side Wilde was descended from a Dutchman, Colonel de Wilde, who went to Ireland with [[William III of England|King William of Orange]]'s invading army in 1690, and numerous Anglo-Irish ancestors. On his mother's side, Wilde's ancestors included a bricklayer from [[County Durham]], who emigrated to Ireland sometime in the 1770s.<ref>{{cite book |last=Pearce |first=Joseph |title=The Unmasking of Oscar Wilde |publisher=Ignatius Press |year=2004 |isbn=978-1-58617-026-4 |location=San Francisco, CA |page=24 |chapter=Mask of Mysteries}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v53UPwpmLhQC&q=Thomas+Wills+Wilde&pg=PA24 |title=Google Books link to Pearce, Joseph 'The Unmasking of Oscar Wilde' |isbn=9781586170264 |access-date=17 October 2015 |archive-date=14 May 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160514164602/https://books.google.com/books?id=v53UPwpmLhQC&pg=PA24&lpg=PA24&dq=Thomas+Wills+Wilde&source=bl&ots=5GU7i_Dd9I&sig=qPpDBYr6f_ri3UBMSLjYRpibga0&hl=en&sa=X&ei=H8xCVOr8Jare7AbX9IHQDg&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=Thomas%20Wills%20Wilde&f=false |url-status=live |last=Pearce |first=Joseph |year=2004}}</ref>

Wilde was baptised as an infant in [[St. Mark's Church, Dublin]], the local [[Church of Ireland]] ([[Anglican]]) church. When the church was closed, the records were moved to the nearby [[St. Ann's Church, Dawson Street]].<ref>{{cite web |title=St. Ann's Church website |url=http://stann.dublin.anglican.org/history/index.php |access-date=15 May 2014 |publisher=Stann.dublin.anglican.org |archive-date=25 October 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171025184141/http://stann.dublin.anglican.org/history/index.php |url-status=live}}</ref> Davis Coakley mentions a second baptism by a Catholic priest, Father Prideaux Fox, who befriended Oscar's mother {{circa}} 1859. According to Fox's testimony in ''Donahoe's Magazine'' in 1905, Jane Wilde would visit his chapel in Glencree, County Wicklow, for Mass, and would take her sons with her. She asked Father Fox in this period to baptise her sons.{{sfn|Coakley|1994|pp=113–114}}

Fox described it in this way:
<blockquote>I am not sure if she ever became a Catholic herself but it was not long before she asked me to instruct two of her children, one of them being the future erratic genius, Oscar Wilde. After a few weeks I baptized these two children, Lady Wilde herself being present on the occasion.</blockquote>

In addition to his two full siblings, Oscar Wilde had three half-siblings, who were born out of wedlock before the marriage of his father: Henry Wilson, born in 1838 to one woman, and Emily and Mary Wilde, born in 1847 and 1849, respectively, to a second woman. Sir William acknowledged paternity of his illegitimate or "natural" children and provided for their education, arranging for them to be reared by his relatives rather than with his legitimate children in his family household with his wife.{{sfn|Ellmann|1988|p=13}}

The family moved to No. 1 [[Merrion Square]] in 1855; there Wilde's sister, Isola Francesca Emily Wilde, was born on 2 April 1857. She was named in tribute to [[Iseult of Ireland]], wife of [[Mark of Cornwall]] and lover of the Cornish knight, [[Sir Tristan]]. She shared the name Francesca with her mother, while Emily was the name of her maternal aunt. Oscar was very close to her and grief struck when she died at the age of nine of a febrile illness.<ref name="it">{{cite news |last=Kingston |first=Angela |date=15 February 2017 |title=Oscar Wilde and the sister's death that haunted his life and work |newspaper=[[The Irish Times]] |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/oscar-wilde-and-the-sister-s-death-that-haunted-his-life-and-work-1.2976363 |access-date=16 January 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Aquien |first=Pascal |date=2006 |title=Oscar Wilde: Les mots et les songes: Biographie |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WHMfAQAAIAAJ&q=%22isola%22+%22wilde%22+iseult |location=Croissy-Beaubourg |publisher=Aden |page=30 |language=fr |isbn=9782848400808 |access-date=26 June 2022}}</ref> Isola lit up their lives like "a golden ray of sunshine dancing about our home".<ref name="isola">{{cite web |date=n.d. |title=Isola Wilde |url=https://womensmuseumofireland.ie/articles/isola-wilde--2 |access-date=16 January 2022 |website=Women's Museum of Ireland |archive-date=18 January 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220118182623/https://womensmuseumofireland.ie/articles/isola-wilde--2 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The Wildes' new home was larger.

Until he was nine, Wilde was educated at home, where a French [[nursemaid]] and a German [[governess]] taught him their languages.{{sfn|Ellmann|1988|p=18}} He joined his brother Willie at [[Portora Royal School]] in [[Enniskillen]], County Fermanagh, which he attended from 1864 to 1871.{{sfn|Ellmann|1988|p=20}} At Portora, although he was not as popular as his older brother, Wilde impressed his peers with the humorous and inventive school stories he told. Later in life he claimed that his fellow students had regarded him as a "prodigy" for his ability to [[speed reading|speed read]], claiming that he could read two facing pages simultaneously and consume a three-volume book in half an hour, retaining enough information to give a basic account of the plot.{{sfn|Ellmann|1988|p=22}} He excelled academically, particularly in the subject of [[Classics]], in which he ranked fourth in the school in 1869. His aptitude for giving oral translations of Greek and Latin texts won him multiple prizes, including the Carpenter Prize for Greek Testament.{{sfn|Ellmann|1988|pp=22–23}} He was one of only three students at Portora to win a Royal School scholarship to Trinity in 1871.{{sfn|Ellmann|1988|p=26}}

Until his early twenties, Wilde summered at the villa, Moytura House, which his father had built in [[Cong, County Mayo]].{{sfn|Sandulescu|1994|pp=55–56}} There the young Wilde and his brother Willie played with [[George Moore (novelist)|George Moore]].<ref>Schwab, Arnold T.: Review of "George Moore: A Reconsideration", by Brown, Malcolm. ''Nineteenth-Century Fiction'', Vol. 10, No. 4, March 1956. pp. 310–314.</ref> Isola died at the age of nine, of [[meningitis]]. Wilde's poem "[[s:Requiescat (Wilde)|Requiescat]]" is written to her memory; the first stanza reads:<ref>''Poems'': Oscar Wilde. (1881) p.&nbsp;37.</ref>

<blockquote>
"Tread lightly, she is near<br />Under the snow<br />
Speak gently, she can hear<br />
the daisies grow"
</blockquote>

== University education: 1870s ==

=== Trinity College, Dublin ===
Wilde left Portora with a royal scholarship to read classics at [[Trinity College, Dublin]] (TCD), from 1871 to 1874,{{sfn|Ellmann|1988|p=25}} sharing rooms with his older brother [[Willie Wilde]]. Trinity, one of the leading classical schools, placed him with scholars such as [[Robert Yelverton Tyrrell|R. Y. Tyrell]], [[Arthur Palmer (scholar)|Arthur Palmer]], [[Edward Dowden]] and his tutor, Professor [[John Pentland Mahaffy|J. P. Mahaffy]], who inspired his interest in [[Greek literature]]. As a student Wilde worked with Mahaffy on the latter's book ''Social Life in Greece''.{{sfn|Sandulescu|1994|p=59}} Wilde, despite later reservations, called Mahaffy "my first and best teacher" and "the scholar who showed me how to love Greek things".{{sfn|Ellmann|1988|p=26}} For his part, Mahaffy boasted of having created Wilde; later, he said Wilde was "the only blot on my tutorship".{{sfn|Ellmann|1988|p=29}}

The [[University Philosophical Society]] also provided an education, as members discussed intellectual and artistic subjects such as [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] and [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]] weekly. Wilde quickly became an established member&nbsp;– the members' suggestion book for 1874 contains two pages of banter (sportingly) mocking Wilde's emergent aestheticism. He presented a paper titled "Aesthetic Morality".{{sfn|Ellmann|1988|p=29}} At Trinity, Wilde established himself as an outstanding student: he came first in his class in his first year, won a [[List of Scholars of Trinity College Dublin|scholarship by competitive examination]] in his second and, in his finals, won the Berkeley Gold Medal in Greek, the University's highest academic award.{{sfn|Sandulescu|1994|p=154}} He was encouraged to compete for a [[demyship]] (a half-scholarship worth £95 (£{{Formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|95|1874|r=-2}}}} today) per year){{Inflation-fn|UK}} to [[Magdalen College, Oxford]]&nbsp;– which he won easily.<ref>{{cite news |title=Oscar Wilde's money diary: how the Irish playwright lived in debt |work=The Telegraph |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/personal-banking/current-accounts/oscar-wildes-money-diary-irish-playwright-lived-debt/ |access-date=26 August 2020 |archive-date=4 June 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200604064052/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/personal-banking/current-accounts/oscar-wildes-money-diary-irish-playwright-lived-debt/ |url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Magdalen College, Oxford ===
At Magdalen, he read [[Greats]] from 1874 to 1878, and from there he applied to join the [[Oxford Union]], but failed to be elected.{{sfn|Toughill|2008|pp=183-185}}

Attracted by its dress, secrecy, and ritual, Wilde petitioned the Apollo [[Masonic Lodge]] at Oxford, and was soon raised to the "Sublime Degree of Master Mason".{{sfn|Ellmann|1988|p=39}} During a resurgent interest in [[Freemasonry]] in his third year, he commented he "would be awfully sorry to give it up if I secede from the Protestant Heresy".{{sfn|Ellmann|1988|p=65}} Wilde's active involvement in Freemasonry lasted only for the time he spent at Oxford; he allowed his membership of the Apollo University Lodge to lapse after failing to pay subscriptions.<ref>{{cite web |title=OSCAR WILDE A University Mason |url=http://www.freemasons-freemasonry.com/beresiner8.html |publisher=PS Review of Freemasonry |access-date=3 August 2016 |archive-date=31 July 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160731185846/http://www.freemasons-freemasonry.com/beresiner8.html |url-status=live}}</ref>

Catholicism deeply appealed to him, especially its rich liturgy, and he discussed converting to it with clergy several times. In 1877, Wilde was left speechless after an audience with [[Pope Pius IX|Pope Pius&nbsp;IX]] in Rome.{{sfn|Ellmann|1988|p=70}} He eagerly read the books of [[John Henry Newman|Cardinal Newman]], a noted Anglican priest who had converted to Catholicism and risen in the church hierarchy. He became more serious in 1878, when he met the Reverend Sebastian Bowden, a priest in the [[Brompton Oratory]] who had received some high-profile converts. Neither his father, who threatened to cut off his funds, nor Mahaffy thought much of the plan; but Wilde, the supreme individualist, balked at the last minute from pledging himself to any formal creed, and on the appointed day of his baptism into Catholicism, sent Father Bowden a bunch of altar lilies instead. Wilde did retain a lifelong interest in Catholic theology and liturgy.{{sfn|Sandulescu|1994|pp=375-376}}

While at Magdalen College, Wilde became particularly well known for his role in the [[Aesthetic movement|aesthetic]] and [[decadent movement]]s. He wore his hair long, openly scorned "manly" sports though he occasionally boxed,{{sfn|Ellmann|1988|p=39}} and he decorated his rooms with [[peacock]] feathers, lilies, [[sunflower]]s, blue china and other ''objets d'art''. He once remarked to friends, whom he entertained lavishly, "I find it harder and harder every day to live up to my blue china."{{sfn|Ellmann|1988|pp=43-44}} The line quickly became famous, accepted as a slogan by aesthetes but used against them by critics who sensed in it a terrible vacuousness.{{sfn|Ellmann|1988|pp=43-44}} Some elements disdained the aesthetes, but their languishing attitudes and showy costumes became a recognised pose.{{sfn|Breen|2000|pp=22–23}} Wilde was once physically attacked by a group of four fellow students, and dealt with them single-handedly, surprising critics.{{sfn|Ellmann|1988|p=44}} By his third year Wilde had truly begun to develop himself and his myth, and considered his learning to be more expansive than what was within the prescribed texts. This attitude resulted in his being [[Rustication (academia)|rusticated]] for one term, after he had returned late to a college term from a trip to Greece with Mahaffy.{{sfn|Ellmann|1988|p=78}}

Wilde did not meet [[Walter Pater]] until his third year, but had been enthralled by his ''Studies in the History of the Renaissance'', published during Wilde's final year in Trinity.{{sfn|Ellmann|1988|p=46}} Pater argued that man's sensibility to beauty should be refined above all else, and that each moment should be felt to its fullest extent. Years later, in ''[[De Profundis (letter)|De Profundis]]'', Wilde described Pater's ''Studies...'' as "that book that has had such a strange influence over my life".{{sfn|Holland|Hart-Davis|2000|p=735}} He learned tracts of the book by heart, and carried it with him on travels in later years. Pater gave Wilde his sense of almost flippant devotion to art, though he gained a purpose for it through the lectures and writings of critic [[John Ruskin]].{{sfn|Ellmann|1988|p=95}} Ruskin despaired at the self-validating aestheticism of Pater, arguing that the importance of art lies in its potential for the betterment of society. Ruskin admired beauty, but believed it must be allied with, and applied to, moral good. When Wilde eagerly attended Ruskin's lecture series ''The Aesthetic and Mathematic Schools of Art in Florence'', he learned about aesthetics as the non-mathematical elements of painting. Despite being given to neither early rising nor manual labour, Wilde volunteered for Ruskin's project to convert a swampy country lane into a smart road neatly edged with flowers.{{sfn|Ellmann|1988|p=95}}

Wilde won the 1878 [[Newdigate Prize]] for his poem "[[s:Ravenna|Ravenna]]", which reflected on his visit there in the previous year, and he duly read it at [[Encaenia]].{{sfn|Ellmann|1988|p=93}} In November 1878, he graduated with a [[First class honours|double first]] in his B.A. of Classical Moderations and [[Literae Humaniores]] (Greats). Wilde wrote to a friend, "The dons are '{{linktext|astonied}}' beyond words&nbsp;– the Bad Boy doing so well in the end!"<!--Do not change this! It appears as 'astonied' in the letter. "Astonied" is a word, and the single quotation marks are the subject's also. -->{{sfn|Holland|Hart-Davis|2000|p=70}}{{sfn|Ellmann|1988|p=94}}

After graduation from Oxford, Wilde returned to Dublin, where he met again [[Florence Balcombe]], a childhood sweetheart.

Celebrated in London’s high society, [[Lillie Langtry]] was introduced to Wilde at Frank Miles' studio in 1877.

Though the book sold out its first print run of 750 copies, it was not generally well received by the critics: ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'', for example, said that "The poet is Wilde, but his poetry's tame".{{sfn|Ellmann|1988|pp=132, 138}}<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-2bO0I-lGvcC&pg=PR6 |title=Collected Poems of Oscar Wilde |publisher=Wordsworth Poetry Library |year=2000 |isbn=1853264539 |editor-last=Varty |editor-first=Anne |location=Ware |page=vi |access-date=23 August 2020 |archive-date=3 August 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210803095614/https://books.google.com/books?id=-2bO0I-lGvcC&pg=PR6 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Wilde |first=Oscar |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B9EfsANd0OcC&pg=PR11 |title=Complete Poetry |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1997 |isbn=0192825089 |editor-last=Murray |editor-first=Isobel |editor-link=Isobel Murray |series=Oxford World's Classics |location=Oxford |pages=x–xi |access-date=23 August 2020 |archive-date=3 August 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210803095612/https://books.google.com/books?id=B9EfsANd0OcC&pg=PR11 |url-status=live}}</ref> By a tight vote, the Oxford Union condemned the book for alleged [[plagiarism]]. <!-- Historians or critics' position?

The book had further printings in 1882. It was bound in a rich, enamel parchment cover (embossed with gilt blossom) and printed on hand-made Dutch paper; over the next few years, Wilde presented many copies to the dignitaries and writers who received him during his lecture tours.{{sfn|Mason|1972|p=282}}

[[Aestheticism]] was sufficiently in vogue to be caricatured by [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] in ''[[Patience (opera)|Patience]]'' (1881). [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]], an English impresario, invited Wilde to make a lecture tour of North America, simultaneously priming the pump for the US tour of ''Patience'' and selling this most charming aesthete to the American public.

In a [[British Library]] article on aestheticism and decadence, Carolyn Burdett writes, "Wilde teased his readers with the claim that [[Life imitating art|life imitates art]] rather than the other way round. His point was a serious one: we notice London fogs, he argued, because art and literature has taught us to do so. Wilde, among others, 'performed' these maxims.

When asked to explain reports that he had paraded down [[Piccadilly]] in London carrying a lily, long hair flowing, Wilde replied, "It's not whether I did it or not that's important, but whether people believed I did it".<ref name="Mendelssohn" /> Wilde believed that the artist should hold forth higher ideals, and that pleasure and beauty would replace utilitarian ethics.{{sfn|Kiberd|2000|pp=329–330}}

Wilde and aestheticism were both mercilessly caricatured and criticised in the press: the ''[[The Republican (Springfield)|Springfield Republican]]'', for instance, commented on Wilde's behaviour during his visit to Boston to lecture on aestheticism, suggesting that Wilde's conduct was more a bid for notoriety rather than devotion to beauty and the aesthetic. [[Thomas Wentworth Higginson|T. W.

His earnings, plus expected income from ''[[The Duchess of Padua]]'', allowed him to move to Paris between February and mid-May 1883. While there he met [[Robert Sherard]], whom he entertained constantly.

He reportedly entertained the other passengers with "[[s:Ave Imperatrix|Ave Imperatrix!, A Poem on England]]", about the rise and fall of empires. [[Edmund Clarence Stedman|E. C.

== Prose writing: 1886–1891 ==

=== Journalism and editorship: 1886–1889 ===
[[File:A Wilde time 3.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A tall man rests on a chaise longue, facing the camera. On his knees, which are held together, he holds a slim, richly bound book. He wears knee breeches which feature prominently in the photograph's foreground.|Wilde reclining with ''Poems'', by [[Napoleon Sarony]] in New York in 1882. Wilde often liked to appear idle, though in fact he worked hard; by the late 1880s he was a father, an editor, and a writer.{{sfn|Ellmann|1988|p=289}}]]

Criticism over artistic matters in ''[[The Pall Mall Gazette]]'' provoked a letter in self-defence, and soon Wilde was a contributor to that and other journals during 1885–87. He enjoyed reviewing and journalism; the form suited his style. He could organise and share his views on art, literature and life, yet in a format less tedious than lecturing. Buoyed up, his reviews were largely chatty and positive.{{sfn|Ellmann|1988|pp=247-248}} Wilde, like his parents before him, also supported the cause of Irish nationalism. When [[Charles Stewart Parnell]] was [[Parnell Commission|falsely accused of inciting murder]], Wilde wrote a series of astute columns defending him in the ''[[Daily Chronicle (United Kingdom)|Daily Chronicle]]''.{{sfn|Ellmann|1988|p=273}}

His flair, having previously been put mainly into socialising, suited journalism and rapidly attracted notice. With his youth nearly over, and a family to support, in mid-1887 Wilde became the editor of ''The Lady's World'' magazine, his name prominently appearing on the cover.{{sfn|Mason|1972|p=219}} He promptly renamed it as ''[[The Woman's World]]'' and raised its tone, adding serious articles on parenting, culture, and politics, while keeping discussions of fashion and arts. Two pieces of fiction were usually included, one to be read to children, the other for the ladies themselves. Wilde worked hard to solicit good contributions from his wide artistic acquaintance, including those of Lady Wilde and his wife Constance, while his own "Literary and Other Notes" were themselves popular and amusing.{{sfn|Ellmann|1988|p=276}}

The initial vigour and excitement which he brought to the job began to fade as administration, commuting and office life became tedious.{{sfn|Clayworth|1997|p=91}} At the same time as Wilde's interest flagged, the publishers became concerned anew about circulation: sales, at the relatively high price of one shilling, remained low.{{sfn|Clayworth|1997|p=95}} Increasingly sending instructions to the magazine by letter, Wilde began a new period of creative work and his own column appeared less regularly.{{sfn|Mason|1972|p=202}}{{sfn|Holland|Hart-Davis|2000|p=404}} In October 1889, Wilde had finally found his voice in prose and, at the end of the second volume, Wilde left ''The Woman's World''.{{sfn|Holland|Hart-Davis|2000|p=413}} The magazine outlasted him by one issue.{{sfn|Mason|1972|p=202}}

If Wilde's period at the helm of the magazine was a mixed success from an organizational point of view, it played a pivotal role in his development as a writer and facilitated his ascent to fame. Whilst Wilde the journalist supplied articles under the guidance of his editors, Wilde the editor was forced to learn to manipulate the literary marketplace on his own terms.{{sfn|Clayworth|1997|pp=85, 86}}

During the late 1880s, Wilde was a close friend of the artist [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler|James McNeill Whistler]] and they dined together on many occasions. At one of these dinners, Whistler said a bon mot that Wilde found particularly witty, Wilde exclaimed that he wished that he had said it, and Whistler retorted "You will, Oscar, you will."{{sfn|Raby|1997|p=6}} [[Herbert Vivian]]—a mutual friend of Wilde and Whistler—attended the dinner and recorded it in his article ''The Reminiscences of a Short Life'', which appeared in [[The Sun (1893–1906)|''The Sun'']] in 1889. The article alleged that Wilde had a habit of passing off other people's witticisms as his own—especially Whistler's. Wilde considered Vivian's article to be a scurrilous betrayal, and it directly caused the broken friendship between Wilde and Whistler.{{sfn|Ellmann|1988|p={{page needed|date=May 2021}}}} The Reminiscences also caused great acrimony between Wilde and Vivian, Wilde accusing Vivian of "the inaccuracy of an eavesdropper with the method of a blackmailer"{{sfn|Spoo|2018|p=31}} and banishing Vivian from his circle.{{sfn|Ellmann|1988|p={{page needed|date=May 2021}}}} Vivian's allegations did not diminish Wilde's reputation as an epigrammatist. London theatre director Luther Munday recounted some of Wilde's typical quips: He said of Whistler that "he had no enemies, but was intensely disliked by his friends." Of [[Hall Caine]] that "he wrote at the top of his voice." Of [[Rudyard Kipling]] that "he revealed life by splendid flashes of vulgarity." Of [[Henry James]] that "he wrote fiction as if it were a painful duty," and of [[Francis Marion Crawford|Marion Crawford]] that "he immolated himself on the altar of local colour."<ref name=Munday>[https://archive.org/stream/cu31924029872060/cu31924029872060_djvu.txt Munday, Luther, ''A Chronicle of Friendships'', p.98 (New York, 1896).]</ref>

Wilde published ''[[The Happy Prince and Other Tales]]'' in 1888, and had been regularly writing fairy stories for magazines. In 1891 he published two more collections, ''[[Lord Arthur Savile's Crime and Other Stories]]'', and in September ''[[A House of Pomegranates]]'' was dedicated "To Constance Mary Wilde".{{sfn|Mason|1972|pp=360-362}} "[[The Portrait of Mr. W.

The only evidence for this is two supposed puns within the sonnets themselves.<ref>{{cite news |last=Lezard |first=Nicholas |author-link=Nicholas Lezard |date=29 March 2003 |title=Oscar Wilde's other portrait |work=[[The Guardian]] |location=London |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/mar/29/classics.oscarwilde |access-date=14 April 2010 |archive-date=29 June 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130629202020/http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2003/mar/29/classics.oscarwilde |url-status=live}}</ref>

The story thus is an early masterpiece of Wilde's combining many elements that interested him: conversation, literature and the idea that to shed oneself of an idea one must first convince another of its truth.{{sfn|Ransome|1912|p=102}} Ransome concludes that Wilde succeeds precisely because the literary criticism is unveiled with such a deft touch.

Though containing nothing but "special pleading", it would not, he says "be possible to build an airier castle in Spain than this of the imaginary William Hughes" we continue listening nonetheless to be charmed by the telling.{{sfn|Ransome|1912|p={{page needed|date=May 2021}}}} "You must believe in Willie Hughes," Wilde told an acquaintance, "I almost do, myself."{{sfn|Ellmann|1988|p=280}}

Wilde, having tired of journalism, had been busy setting out his aesthetic ideas more fully in a series of longer prose pieces which were published in the major literary-intellectual journals of the day. In January 1889, ''The Decay of Lying: A Dialogue'' appeared in ''[[The Nineteenth Century]]'', and ''Pen, Pencil and Poison'', a satirical biography of [[Thomas Griffiths Wainewright]], in ''[[The Fortnightly Review]]'', edited by Wilde's friend [[Frank Harris]].{{sfn|Mason|1972|p=71}} Two of Wilde's four writings on aesthetics are dialogues: though Wilde had evolved professionally from lecturer to writer, he retained an oral tradition of sorts. Having always excelled as a wit and raconteur, he often composed by assembling phrases, ''bons mots'' and witticisms into a longer, cohesive work.{{sfn|Raby|1997|p=98}}

Wilde was concerned about the effect of moralising on art; he believed in art's redemptive, developmental powers: "Art is individualism, and individualism is a disturbing and disintegrating force. There lies its immense value. For what it seeks is to disturb monotony of type, slavery of custom, tyranny of habit, and the reduction of man to the level of a machine."<ref name="soulofman">Wilde, O. ''The Complete Works of Oscar Wilde'', Collins.</ref> In his only political text, ''The Soul of Man Under Socialism'', he argued political conditions should establish this primacy – private property should be abolished, and cooperation should be substituted for competition. He wrote "Socialism, Communism, or whatever one chooses to call it, by converting private property into public wealth, and substituting co-operation for competition, will restore society to its proper condition of a thoroughly healthy organism, and insure the material well-being of each member of the community. It will, in fact, give Life its proper basis and its proper environment". At the same time, he stressed that the government most amenable to artists was no government at all. Wilde envisioned a society where mechanisation has freed human effort from the burden of necessity, effort which can instead be expended on artistic creation. [[George Orwell]] summarised, "In effect, the world will be populated by artists, each striving after perfection in the way that seems best to him."<ref>Orwell, George [https://web.archive.org/web/20160120071748/http://www.geocities.jp/mickindex/orwell/orwell_ROW_en.html Review: The Soul of Man under Socialism by Oscar Wilde] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170329102905/http://www.geocities.jp/mickindex/orwell/orwell_ROW_en.html |date=29 March 2017}} ''[[The Observer]]'', 8 May 1948.

Wilde considered including this pamphlet and "[[The Portrait of Mr. W.

''Intentions'' packaged revisions of four essays: ''The Decay of Lying''; ''Pen, Pencil and Poison''; ''The Truth of Masks'' (first published 1885); and ''The Critic as Artist'' in two parts.{{sfn|Mason|1972|pp=355-357}} For Pearson the biographer, the essays and dialogues exhibit every aspect of Wilde's genius and character: wit, romancer, talker, lecturer, humanist and scholar and concludes that "no other productions of his have as varied an appeal".<ref>Pearson, H.

=== ''The Picture of Dorian Gray'' ===
{{main|The Picture of Dorian Gray|l1=''The Picture of Dorian Gray''}}
[[File:Oscar Wilde and Arthur Conan Doyle green plaque (Westminster).jpg|thumb|upright|Plaque commemorating the dinner between Wilde, [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] and the publisher of ''Lippincott's Monthly Magazine'' on 30 August 1889 at the [[Langham Hotel, London]], that led to Wilde writing ''The Picture of Dorian Gray'']]
The first version of ''The Picture of Dorian Gray'' was published as the lead story in the July 1890 edition of ''[[Lippincott's Monthly Magazine]]'', along with five others.{{sfn|Mason|1972|p=105}} The story begins with a man painting a picture of Gray. When Gray, who has a "face like ivory and rose leaves", sees his finished portrait, he breaks down. Distraught that his beauty will fade while the portrait stays beautiful, he inadvertently makes a [[Deal with the Devil|Faustian bargain]] in which only the painted image grows old while he stays beautiful and young. For Wilde, the purpose of art would be to guide life as if beauty alone were its object. As Gray's portrait allows him to escape the corporeal ravages of his hedonism, Wilde sought to juxtapose the beauty he saw in art with daily life.<ref name="Mendelsohn" />

Reviewers immediately criticised the novel's decadence and homosexual allusions; ''[[Daily Chronicle (United Kingdom)|The Daily Chronicle]]'' for example, called it "unclean", "poisonous", and "heavy with the mephitic odours of moral and spiritual putrefaction".<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Ross |first=Alex |author-link=Alex Ross (music critic) |date=1 August 2011 |title=Deceptive Picture: How Oscar Wilde painted over "Dorian Gray" |url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/08/08/deceptive-picture |access-date=3 August 2011 |magazine=[[The New Yorker]] |archive-date=6 October 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006051046/http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/08/08/deceptive-picture |url-status=live}}</ref> Wilde vigorously responded, writing to the editor of the ''Scots Observer'', in which he clarified his stance on ethics and aesthetics in art – "If a work of art is rich and vital and complete, those who have artistic instincts will see its beauty and those to whom ethics appeal more strongly will see its moral lesson."{{sfn|Holland|Hart-Davis|2000|pp=433, 435, 438, 441, 446}} He nevertheless revised it extensively for book publication in 1891: six new chapters were added, some overtly decadent passages and homo-eroticism excised, and a preface was included consisting of twenty-two epigrams, such as "Books are well written, or badly written. That is all."<ref>{{cite book |title=The Picture of Dorian Gray |date=October 1994 |publisher=From Project Gutenberg transcription |chapter=Preface |chapter-url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/174/174-h/174-h.htm |access-date=30 August 2010 |archive-date=6 November 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191106080616/http://www.gutenberg.org/files/174/174-h/174-h.htm |url-status=live}}</ref>{{sfn|Mason|1972|p=341}}

Contemporary reviewers and modern critics have postulated numerous possible sources of the story, a search Jershua McCormack argues is futile because Wilde "has tapped a root of Western folklore so deep and ubiquitous that the story has escaped its origins and returned to the oral tradition".{{sfn|Raby|1997|p=111}} Wilde claimed the plot was "an idea that is as old as the history of literature but to which I have given a new form".{{sfn|Holland|Hart-Davis|2000|p=435}} Modern critic Robin McKie considered the novel to be technically mediocre, saying that the conceit of the plot had guaranteed its fame, but the device is never pushed to its full.<ref>McKie, Robin (25 January 2009).

Not content with being better known than ever in London, though, he returned to Paris in October 1891, this time as a respected writer. He was received at the ''[[salon (gathering)|salons]] littéraires'', including the famous ''mardis'' of [[Stéphane Mallarmé]], a renowned [[symbolism (arts)|symbolist]] poet of the time.{{sfn|Ellmann|1988|p=316}} Wilde's two plays during the 1880s, ''[[Vera; or, The Nihilists]]'' and ''[[The Duchess of Padua]]'', had not met with much success. He had continued his interest in the theatre and now, after finding his voice in prose, his thoughts turned again to the dramatic form as the biblical iconography of [[Salome]] filled his mind.{{sfn|Ellmann|1988|p=322}} One evening, after discussing depictions of Salome throughout history, he returned to his hotel and noticed a blank copybook lying on the desk, and it occurred to him to write in it what he had been saying. The result was a new play, ''[[Salome (play)|Salomé]]'', written rapidly and in French.{{sfn|Ellmann|1988|p=323}}

A tragedy, it tells the story of Salome, the stepdaughter of the [[Tetrarchy (Judea)|tetrarch]] [[Herod Antipas]], who, to her stepfather's dismay but [[Herodias|mother]]'s delight, requests the head of Jokanaan ([[John the Baptist]]) on a silver platter as a reward for dancing the Dance of the Seven Veils. When Wilde returned to London just before Christmas the ''Paris Echo'' referred to him as ''"le great event"'' of the season.{{sfn|Ellmann|1988|p=326}} Rehearsals of the play, starring [[Sarah Bernhardt]], began but the play was refused a licence by the Lord Chamberlain, since it depicted biblical characters.{{sfn|Mason|1972|p=371}} ''Salome'' was published jointly in Paris and London in 1893, but was not performed until 1896 in Paris, during Wilde's later incarceration.{{sfn|Mason|1972|p=369}}

[[File:Windermere Lake District from hill.JPG|thumb|right|upright=1.1|Lake [[Windermere]] in northern England where Wilde began working on his first hit play, ''[[Lady Windermere's Fan]]'' (1892), during a summer visit in 1891.<ref>{{cite news |title=An introduction to Lady Windermere's Fan |agency=British Library |url=https://www.bl.uk/romantics-and-victorians/articles/an-introduction-to-lady-windermeres-fan |access-date=23 August 2020 |archive-date=27 October 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201027163807/https://www.bl.uk/romantics-and-victorians/articles/an-introduction-to-lady-windermeres-fan |url-status=live}}</ref>]]
Wilde, who had first set out to irritate Victorian society with his dress and talking points, then to outrage it with ''Dorian Gray'', his novel of vice hidden beneath art, finally found a way to critique society on its own terms. ''Lady Windermere's Fan'' was first performed on 20 February 1892 at St James's Theatre, packed with the cream of society. On the surface a witty comedy, there is subtle subversion underneath: "it concludes with collusive concealment rather than collective disclosure".{{sfn|Ellmann|1988|p=344}} The audience, like Lady Windermere, are forced to soften harsh social codes in favour of a more nuanced view. The play was enormously popular, touring the country for months, but largely trashed by conservative critics.{{sfn|Ellmann|1988|p=347}} The success of the play saw Wilde earn £7,000 in the first year alone (worth £{{Formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|7000|1892|r=-2}}}} as of June 2022).{{Inflation-fn|UK}}{{sfn|Ellmann|1988|p=315}}

His first hit play was followed by ''A Woman of No Importance'' in 1893, another Victorian comedy, revolving around the spectre of illegitimate births, mistaken identities and late revelations.{{sfn|Ellmann|1988|p=360}} Wilde was commissioned to write two more plays and ''An Ideal Husband'', written in 1894,<ref>{{Cite book |last=Wilde |first=Oscar |title=An ideal husband. Act III: London: typescript with extensive autograph revisions, 1894 |oclc=270589204}}</ref> followed in January 1895.{{sfn|Ellmann|1988|p=404}}

Peter Raby said these essentially English plays were well-pitched: "Wilde, with one eye on the dramatic genius of Ibsen, and the other on the commercial competition in London's [[West End theatre|West End]], targeted his audience with adroit precision".{{sfn|Raby|1997|p=146}}

=== Queensberry family ===
[[File:Wilde Douglas British Library B20147-85.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Wilde and [[Lord Alfred Douglas]] in 1893]]
In mid-1891 [[Lionel Johnson]] introduced Wilde to [[Lord Alfred Douglas]], Johnson's cousin, who was at the time an undergraduate at Oxford.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Riley |first1=Kathleen |last2=Blanshard |first2=Alastair |last3=Manny |first3=Iarla |title=Oscar Wilde and classical antiquity |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |edition=first |year=2018 |oclc=986815031 |isbn=978-0-19-878926-0}}</ref> Known to his family and friends as "Bosie", he was a handsome and spoilt young man. An intimate friendship sprang up between Wilde and Douglas and by 1893 Wilde was infatuated with Douglas and they consorted together regularly in a tempestuous affair. If Wilde was relatively indiscreet, even flamboyant, in the way he acted, Douglas was reckless in public. Wilde, who was earning up to £100 a week from his plays (his salary at ''The Woman's World'' had been £6), indulged Douglas's every whim: material, artistic, or sexual.

Douglas soon initiated Wilde into the Victorian underground of gay prostitution, and Wilde was introduced to a series of young working-class male prostitutes ([[rent boys]]) from 1892 onwards by Alfred Taylor. These infrequent rendezvous usually took the same form: Wilde would meet the boy, offer him gifts, dine him privately and then take him to a hotel room. Unlike Wilde's idealised relations with Ross, [[John Gray (poet)|John Gray]], and Douglas, all of whom remained part of his aesthetic circle, these consorts were uneducated and knew nothing of literature. Soon his public and private lives had become sharply divided; in ''[[De Profundis (letter)|De Profundis]]'' he wrote to Douglas that "It was like feasting with panthers; the danger was half the excitement... I did not know that when they were to strike at me it was to be at another's piping and at another's pay."{{sfn|Holland|Hart-Davis|2000|p={{page needed|date=May 2021}}}}

Douglas and some Oxford friends founded a journal, ''[[The Chameleon (magazine)|The Chameleon]]'', to which Wilde "sent a page of paradoxes originally destined for the [[Saturday Review (London newspaper)|''Saturday Review'']]".{{sfn|Holland|Hart-Davis|2000|p=702}} "[[s:Phrases and Philosophies for the Use of the Young|Phrases and Philosophies for the Use of the Young]]" was to come under attack six months later at Wilde's trial, where he was forced to defend the magazine to which he had sent his work.{{sfn|Holland|Hart-Davis|2000|p=703}} In any case, it became unique: ''The Chameleon'' was not published again.

Lord Alfred's father, the [[John Douglas, 9th Marquess of Queensberry|Marquess of Queensberry]], was known for his outspoken atheism, brutish manner and creation of the modern rules of boxing.{{efn|Queensberry's oldest son, [[Francis Douglas, Viscount Drumlanrig]], possibly had an intimate association with [[Archibald Philip Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery]], the Prime Minister to whom he was private secretary, which ended with Drumlanrig's death in an unexplained shooting accident. In any case the Marquess of Queensberry came to believe his sons had been corrupted by older homosexuals or, as he phrased it in a letter in the aftermath of Drumlanrig's death: "Montgomerys, The Snob Queers like Rosebery and certainly Christian Hypocrite like Gladstone and the whole lot of you".{{sfn|Ellmann|1988|p=402}}}} Queensberry, who feuded regularly with his son, confronted Wilde and Lord Alfred about the nature of their relationship several times, but Wilde was able to mollify him. In June 1894, he called on Wilde at 16 Tite Street, without an appointment, and clarified his stance: "I do not say that you are it, but you look it, and pose at it, which is just as bad. And if I catch you and my son again in any public restaurant I will thrash you" to which Wilde responded: "I don't know what the Queensberry rules are, but the Oscar Wilde rule is to shoot on sight".{{sfn|Ellmann|1988|p=421}} His account in ''De Profundis'' was less triumphant: "It was when, in my library at Tite Street, waving his small hands in the air in epileptic fury, your father... stood uttering every foul word his foul mind could think of, and screaming the loathsome threats he afterwards with such cunning carried out".{{sfn|Holland|Hart-Davis|2000|pp=699–700}}{{sfn|Ellmann|1988|p=396}} Queensberry only described the scene once, saying Wilde had "shown him the [[white feather]]", meaning he had acted in a cowardly way.{{sfn|Ellmann|1988|p=396}} Though trying to remain calm, Wilde saw that he was becoming ensnared in a brutal family quarrel. He did not wish to bear Queensberry's insults, but he knew to confront him could lead to disaster were his liaisons disclosed publicly.

=== ''The Importance of Being Earnest'' ===
{{main|The Importance of Being Earnest|l1=''The Importance of Being Earnest''}}
Wilde's final play again returns to the theme of switched identities: the play's two protagonists engage in "bunburying" (the maintenance of alternative personas in the town and country) which allows them to escape Victorian social mores.<ref name="Mendelsohn">{{cite magazine |last=Mendelsohn |first=Daniel |author-link=Daniel Mendelsohn |date=10 October 2002 |title=The Two Oscar Wildes |url=https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2002/10/10/the-two-oscar-wildes/ |magazine=[[New York Review of Books]] |volume=49 |access-date=1 April 2020 |number=15 |url-access=limited |archive-date=6 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200806024640/https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2002/10/10/the-two-oscar-wildes/ |url-status=live}}</ref> ''Earnest'' is even lighter in tone than Wilde's earlier comedies. While their characters often rise to serious themes in moments of crisis, ''Earnest'' lacks the by-now-stock Wildean characters: there is no "woman with a past", the principals are neither villainous nor cunning, simply idle cultivés, and the idealistic young women are not that innocent. Mostly set in drawing rooms and almost completely lacking in action or violence, ''Earnest'' lacks the self-conscious decadence found in ''[[The Picture of Dorian Gray]]'' and ''[[Salome (play)|Salome]]''.{{sfn|Raby|1997|pp=166-167}}

The play, now considered Wilde's [[Chef d'oeuvre|masterpiece]], was rapidly written in Wilde's artistic maturity in late 1894.{{sfn|Ellmann|1988|p=398}} It was first performed on 14 February 1895, at [[St James's Theatre]] in London, Wilde's second collaboration with [[George Alexander (actor)|George Alexander]], the actor-manager. Both author and producer assiduously revised, prepared and rehearsed every line, scene and setting in the months before the premiere, creating a carefully constructed representation of late-Victorian society, yet simultaneously mocking it.{{sfn|Raby|1997|p=161}} During rehearsal Alexander requested that Wilde shorten the play from four acts to three, which the author did. Premieres at St James's seemed like "brilliant parties", and the opening of ''The Importance of Being Earnest'' was no exception. [[Allan Aynesworth]] (who played Algernon) recalled to [[Hesketh Pearson]], "In my fifty-three years of acting, I never remember a greater triumph than [that] first night."<ref>{{cite book |last=Pearson |first=Hesketh |title=Oscar Wilde: His Life and Wit |year=1946 |page=257}}</ref> ''Earnest''{{'}}s immediate reception as Wilde's best work to date finally crystallised his fame into a solid artistic reputation.<ref name="wheatcroft">{{cite magazine |last=Wheatcroft |first=Geoffrey |author-link=Geoffrey Wheatcroft |date=May 2003 |title=Not Green, Not Red, Not Pink |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/past/docs/issues/2003/05/wheatcroft.htm |magazine=The Atlantic Monthly |access-date=10 March 2017 |archive-date=22 May 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522160423/http://www.theatlantic.com/past/docs/issues/2003/05/wheatcroft.htm |url-status=live}}</ref> In a review of the play for ''[[The Pall Mall Gazette]]'' [[H.

Wilde's professional success was mirrored by an escalation in his feud with Queensberry. Queensberry had planned to insult Wilde publicly by throwing a bouquet of rotting vegetables onto the stage; Wilde was tipped off and had Queensberry barred from entering the theatre.{{sfn|Morley|1976|p=102}} Fifteen weeks later Wilde was in prison.

=== ''Wilde v Queensberry'' ===
On 18 February 1895, the Marquess of Queensberry left his calling card at Wilde's club, the [[Albemarle Club|Albemarle]], inscribed: "For Oscar Wilde, posing somdomite{{sic}}".{{sfn|Holland|2004|p=300}}{{efn|Queensberry's handwriting was almost indecipherable: The hall porter initially read "ponce and sodomite", but Queensberry himself claimed that he'd written "posing 'as' a sodomite", an easier accusation to defend in court.

Queensberry was arrested for [[criminal libel]], a charge carrying a possible sentence of up to two years in prison. Under the [[Libel Act 1843|1843 Libel Act]], Queensberry could avoid conviction for libel only by demonstrating that his accusation was in fact true, and furthermore that there was some "public benefit" to having made the accusation openly.<ref name="Moran2002">{{cite book |last=Moran |first=Leslie |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9TSIAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA47 |title=The Homosexual(ity) of law |publisher=[[Routledge]] |year=2002 |isbn=978-1-134-89645-5 |page=47 |access-date=6 November 2018 |archive-date=18 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200818213826/https://books.google.com/books?id=9TSIAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA47 |url-status=live}}</ref> Queensberry's lawyers thus hired private detectives to find evidence of Wilde's homosexual liaisons.<ref name="Frankel2017">{{cite book |last=Frankel |first=Nicholas |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d4M4DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA34 |title=Oscar Wilde: The Unrepentant Years |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=2017 |isbn=978-0-674-98202-4 |page=34 |access-date=6 November 2018 |archive-date=19 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200819030513/https://books.google.com/books?id=d4M4DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA34 |url-status=live}}</ref>

Wilde's friends had advised him against the prosecution at a ''Saturday Review'' meeting at the [[Hotel Café Royal|Café Royal]] on 24 March 1895; [[Frank Harris]] warned him that "they are going to prove sodomy against you" and advised him to flee to France.{{sfn|Belford|2000|p=251}} Wilde and Douglas walked out in a huff, Wilde saying "it is at such moments as these that one sees who are one's true friends". The scene was witnessed by [[George Bernard Shaw]] who recalled it to [[Arthur Ransome]] a day or so before Ransome's trial for libelling Douglas in 1913. To Ransome it confirmed what he had said in his 1912 book on Wilde: that Douglas's rivalry for Wilde with [[Robbie Ross]] and his arguments with his father had resulted in Wilde's public disaster, as Wilde wrote in [[De Profundis (letter)|''De Profundis'']]. Douglas lost his case. Shaw included an account of the argument between Harris, Douglas and Wilde in the preface to his play ''[[The Dark Lady of the Sonnets]]''.<ref>''The Autobiography of Arthur Ransome'' pp 151–152 (1976, Jonathan Cape, London) {{ISBN|0-224-01245-2}}</ref><ref>''The Life of Arthur Ransome'' by [[Hugh Brogan]] p85 (1984, Jonathan Cape, London) {{ISBN|0-224-02010-2}}</ref>

The libel trial became a ''[[cause célèbre]]'' as salacious details of Wilde's private life with Taylor and Douglas began to appear in the press. A team of private detectives had directed Queensberry's lawyers, led by [[Edward Carson]] [[Queen's Counsel|QC]], to the world of the Victorian underground. Wilde's association with blackmailers and male prostitutes, cross-dressers and homosexual brothels was recorded, and various persons involved were interviewed, some being coerced to appear as witnesses since they too were accomplices to the crimes of which Wilde was accused.{{sfn|Ellmann|1988|p=415}}

The trial opened at the [[Old Bailey]] on 3 April 1895 before Justice [[Richard Collins, Baron Collins|Richard Henn Collins]], a fellow Dubliner, amid scenes of near hysteria both in the press and the public galleries. The extent of the evidence massed against Wilde forced him to declare meekly, "I am the prosecutor in this case".{{sfn|Ellmann|1988|p=418}} Wilde's lawyer, [[Edward Clarke (barrister)|Sir Edward Clarke]], opened the case by pre-emptively asking Wilde about two suggestive letters Wilde had written to Douglas, which the defence had in its possession. He characterised the first as a "prose sonnet" and admitted that the "poetical language" might seem strange to the court but claimed its intent was innocent. Wilde stated that the letters had been obtained by blackmailers who had attempted to extort money from him, but he had refused, suggesting they should take the £60 (equal to £{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|60|1895|r=-2}}}} today) offered, "unusual for a prose piece of that length". He claimed to regard the letters as works of art rather than something of which to be ashamed.{{sfn|Foldy|1997|p=3}}

Carson, who was also a Dubliner who had attended [[Trinity College, Dublin]], at the same time as Wilde, cross-examined Wilde on how he perceived the moral content of his works. Wilde replied with characteristic wit and flippancy, claiming that works of art are not capable of being moral or immoral but only well or poorly made, and that only "brutes and illiterates", whose views on art "are incalculably stupid", would make such judgements about art. Carson, a leading barrister, diverged from the normal practice of asking [[closed question]]s. Carson pressed Wilde on each topic from every angle, squeezing out nuances of meaning from Wilde's answers, removing them from their aesthetic context and portraying Wilde as evasive and decadent. While Wilde won the most laughs from the court, Carson scored the most legal points.{{sfn|Foldy|1997|p=8}} To undermine Wilde's credibility, and to justify Queensberry's description of Wilde as a "posing somdomite", Carson drew from the witness an admission of his capacity for "posing", by demonstrating that he had lied about his age under oath.<ref>{{cite web |last=Linder |first=Douglas O. |title=Testimony of Oscar Wilde on Direct Examination (April 3,1895) |url=https://www.famous-trials.com/wilde/347-wildedirect |access-date=29 November 2020 |website=Famous Trials |publisher=University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Law |archive-date=17 August 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210817175646/https://www.famous-trials.com/wilde/347-wildedirect |url-status=live}}</ref>{{efn|Wilde, age forty, had earlier stated he was thirty-nine years old at the beginning of his direct examination by Clarke.

You have my certificate and that settles the matter."<ref>{{cite web |last=Linder |first=Douglas O. |title=Testimony of Oscar Wilde on Cross Examination (April 3, 1895) (Literary Part) |url=https://www.famous-trials.com/wilde/346-literarypart |access-date=30 November 2020 |website=Famous Trials |publisher=University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Law |archive-date=12 December 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201212151649/https://www.famous-trials.com/wilde/346-literarypart |url-status=live}}</ref>}} Playing on this, he returned to the topic throughout his cross-examination.<ref>{{cite book |last=Marjoribanks |first=Edward |title=Carson the Advocate |publisher=Macmillan |year=1932 |location=London |page=213 |oclc=679460 |quote=Carson had again and again used the word "pose" with ironic emphasis. |author-link=Edward Marjoribanks (Conservative politician)}}</ref> Carson also tried to justify Queensberry's characterisation by quoting from Wilde's novel, ''The Picture of Dorian Gray'', referring in particular to a scene in the second chapter, in which Lord Henry Wotton explains his decadent philosophy to Dorian, an "innocent young man", in Carson's words.{{sfn|Stern|2017|p=758|ps=. "Carson began by emphasizing that at this point in the novel, Dorian is an 'innocent young man'."}}

Carson then moved to the factual evidence and questioned Wilde about his friendships with younger, lower-class men. Wilde admitted being on a first-name basis and lavishing gifts upon them, but insisted that nothing untoward had occurred and that the men were merely good friends of his. Carson repeatedly pointed out the unusual nature of these relationships and insinuated that the men were prostitutes. Wilde replied that he did not believe in social barriers, and simply enjoyed the society of young men. Then Carson asked Wilde directly whether he had ever kissed a certain servant boy, Wilde responded, "Oh, dear no. He was a particularly plain boy&nbsp;– unfortunately ugly&nbsp;– I pitied him for it."{{sfn|Foldy|1997|p=17}} Carson pressed him on the answer, repeatedly asking why the boy's ugliness was relevant. Wilde hesitated, then for the first time became flustered: "You sting me and insult me and try to unnerve me; and at times one says things flippantly when one ought to speak more seriously."{{sfn|Foldy|1997|p=17}}

In his opening speech for the defence, Carson announced that he had located several male prostitutes who were to testify that they had had sex with Wilde. On the advice of his lawyers, Wilde dropped the prosecution. Queensberry was found not guilty, as the court declared that his accusation that Wilde was "posing as a Somdomite {{sic}}" was justified, "true in substance and in fact".{{sfn|Foldy|1997|p=19}} Under the [[Libel Act 1843]], Queensberry's acquittal rendered Wilde legally liable for the considerable expenses Queensberry had incurred in his defence, which left Wilde bankrupt.{{sfn|Foldy|1997|p=150}}

=== ''Regina v Wilde'' ===
After Wilde left the court, a warrant for his arrest was applied for on charges of [[sodomy]] and [[Gross indecency between men|gross indecency]]. [[Robbie Ross]] found Wilde at the Cadogan Hotel,<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000378/18950406/022/0005 |url-access=subscription |title=The Arrest of Oscar Wilde at the Cadogan Hotel |date=6 April 1895 |newspaper=[[Hartlepool Mail]] |access-date=15 May 2021}} Via {{cite web |title=The Arrest of Oscar Wilde at the Cadogan Hotel – 6 April 1895 |url=https://blog.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/2013/04/05/the-arrest-of-oscar-wilde-at-the-cadogan-hotel-6-april-1895/ |website=[[British Newspaper Archive]] |date=5 April 2013 |access-date=27 November 2018 |archive-date=27 November 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181127194250/https://blog.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/2013/04/05/the-arrest-of-oscar-wilde-at-the-cadogan-hotel-6-april-1895/ |url-status=live}}</ref> [[Pont Street]], [[Knightsbridge]], with [[Reginald Turner]]. Both men advised Wilde to go at once to [[Dover]] and try to get a boat to France; his mother advised him to stay and fight. Wilde, lapsing into inaction, could only say, "The train has gone. It's too late."{{sfn|Ellmann|1988|p=455}} On 6 April 1895, Wilde was arrested for "gross indecency" under Section 11 of the [[Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885]], a term meaning homosexual acts not amounting to [[buggery]] (an offence under a separate statute).{{efn|See [[Offences against the Person Act 1861#Unnatural offences|Offences Against the Person Act 1861, ss 61, 62]]}}{{sfn|Hyde|1948|p=5}} At Wilde's instruction, Ross and Wilde's butler forced their way into the bedroom and library of 16 Tite Street, packing some personal effects, manuscripts, and letters.{{sfn|Ellmann|1988|p=429}} Wilde was then imprisoned on remand at [[Holloway (HM Prison)|Holloway]], where he received daily visits from Douglas.

Events moved quickly and his prosecution opened on 26 April 1895, before [[Arthur Charles (judge)|Mr Justice Charles]]. Wilde pleaded [[not guilty (plea)|not guilty]]. He had already begged Douglas to leave London for Paris, but Douglas complained bitterly, even wanting to give evidence; he was pressed to go and soon fled to the Hotel du Monde. Fearing persecution, Ross and many others also left the United Kingdom during this time. Under cross-examination Wilde was at first hesitant, then spoke eloquently:

'''Charles Gill''' (prosecuting): What is "[[the love that dare not speak its name]]"?

'''Wilde:''' "The love that dare not speak its name" in this century is such a great affection of an elder for a younger man as there was between David and Jonathan, such as Plato made the very basis of his philosophy, and such as you find in the sonnets of Michelangelo and Shakespeare. It is that deep spiritual affection that is as pure as it is perfect. It dictates and pervades great works of art, like those of Shakespeare and Michelangelo, and those two letters of mine, such as they are. It is in this century misunderstood, so much misunderstood that it may be described as "the love that dare not speak its name", and on that account of it I am placed where I am now. It is beautiful, it is fine, it is the noblest form of affection. There is nothing unnatural about it. It is intellectual, and it repeatedly exists between an older and a younger man, when the older man has intellect, and the younger man has all the joy, hope and glamour of life before him. That it should be so, the world does not understand. The world mocks at it, and sometimes puts one in the pillory for it.<ref>[http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/wilde/sentence.html Transcript of Wilde's trial, published online by University of Missouri-Kansas City Law School] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101223135533/http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/wilde/sentence.html |date=23 December 2010}}</ref>{{sfn|Ellmann|1988|p=435}}}}

This response was counter-productive in a legal sense, for it only served to reinforce the charges of homosexual behaviour. The trial ended with the jury unable to reach a verdict. Wilde's counsel, Sir Edward Clarke, was finally able to get a magistrate to allow Wilde and his friends to post bail.<ref name="oldbailey">{{Old Bailey|defendant=Oscar Fingal O'Fflahartie Wills Wilde, Alfred Waterhouse Somerset Taylor|trialdate=22 April 1895|id= t18950520-425|access-date=22 April 2010}}</ref> The Reverend [[Stewart Headlam]] put up most of the £5,000 surety required by the court, having disagreed with Wilde's treatment by the press and the courts.{{sfn|Foldy|1997|p=40}} Wilde was freed from Holloway and, shunning attention, went into hiding at the house of Ernest and [[Ada Leverson]], two of his firm friends.

The final trial was presided over by [[Alfred Wills|Mr Justice Wills]]. On 25 May 1895, Wilde and Alfred Taylor were convicted of gross indecency and sentenced to two years' hard labour.<ref name="oldbailey" /> The judge described the sentence, the maximum allowed, as "totally inadequate for a case such as this", and that the case was "the worst case I have ever tried".{{sfn|Foldy|1997|p=47}} Wilde's response "And I?

Although it is widely believed that the charges were related to Wilde's consensual activities, ''The Trials of Oscar Wilde'', which includes an original transcript of the libel trial (which came to light in 2000), suggests that he took advantage of teenagers.<ref name="Trials" /> Antony Edmonds feels that Wilde would have faced prosecution today: "For example, he certainly paid for sex with youths under the age of 18 which is a criminal offence. But even if his activities had led only to exposure and not to arrest, he would have been savagely pilloried in the media. Wilde was 39 when he seduced Alphonse Conway, and Conway was an inexperienced boy of 16".<ref name="Trials" /> However, Oscar Wilde's grandson, [[Merlin Holland]], argues: "One is taking it out of context, he was not an odious predator. The boys seemed to be willing partners and there appeared to be a relationship going on between him and them".<ref name="Trials" /> [[Marriageable age#Post-classical history|Marriageable age]] (and the age of consent) in England was 16 at the time, having been 13 as recently as 1885: the 1875 [[Offences against the Person Act 1875]] raised the age of consent to 13 years old, and a decade later, the [[Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885]] raised the age of consent to 16 years old, just ten years before the trial.

Wilde was incarcerated from 25 May 1895 to 18 May 1897.

He first entered [[Newgate Prison]] in London for processing, then was moved to [[HM Prison Pentonville|Pentonville Prison]], where the "hard labour" to which he had been sentenced consisted of many hours of walking a [[Penal treadmill|treadmill]] and picking [[oakum]] (separating the fibres in scraps of old navy ropes),{{sfn|Ellmann|1988|p=769}} and where prisoners were allowed to read only the Bible and ''[[The Pilgrim's Progress]]''.{{sfn|Ellmann|1988|p=777}}

A few months later he was moved to [[HM Prison Wandsworth|Wandsworth Prison]] in London. Inmates there also followed the regimen of "hard labour, hard fare and a hard bed", which wore harshly on Wilde's delicate health.{{sfn|Ellmann|1988|p=474}} In November he collapsed during chapel from illness and hunger.

About five months after Wilde arrived at Reading Gaol, [[Charles Thomas Wooldridge]], a trooper in the Royal Horse Guards, was brought to Reading to await his trial for murdering his wife on 29 March 1896; on 17 June Wooldridge was sentenced to death and returned to Reading for his execution, which took place on Tuesday, 7 July 1896 – the first hanging at Reading in 18 years. From Wooldridge's hanging, Wilde later wrote ''[[The Ballad of Reading Gaol]]''.

Wilde was not, at first, even allowed paper and pen, but Haldane eventually succeeded in allowing access to books and writing materials.{{sfn|Ellmann|1988|p=475}} Wilde requested, among others, the Bible in French; Italian and German grammars; some Ancient Greek texts; [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s ''[[Divine Comedy]]''; [[Joris-Karl Huysmans]]'s new French novel about Christian redemption, ''[[En route (novel)|En route]]''; and essays by [[Augustine of Hippo|St Augustine]], [[John Henry Newman|Cardinal Newman]] and Walter Pater.{{sfn|Ellmann|1988|pp=477-478}}

Between January and March 1897 Wilde wrote a 50,000-word letter to Douglas. He was not allowed to send it, but was permitted to take it with him when released from prison.{{sfn|Holland|Hart-Davis|2000|p=683}} In reflective mode, Wilde coldly examines his career to date, how he had been a colourful ''[[agent provocateur]]'' in Victorian society, his art, like his paradoxes, seeking to subvert as well as sparkle. His own estimation of himself was: one who "stood in symbolic relations to the art and culture of my age".{{sfn|Holland|Hart-Davis|2000|pp=737–738}} It was from these heights that his life with Douglas began, and Wilde examines that particularly closely, repudiating him for what Wilde finally sees as his arrogance and vanity: he had not forgotten Douglas' remark, when he was ill, "When you are not on your pedestal you are not interesting."{{sfn|Holland|Hart-Davis|2000|p=700}} Wilde blamed himself, though, for the ethical degradation of character that he allowed Douglas to bring about in him, and took responsibility for his own fall: "I am here for having tried to put your father in prison."<ref name=wheatcroft/> The first half concludes with Wilde forgiving Douglas, for his own sake as much as Douglas's. The second half of the letter traces Wilde's spiritual journey of redemption and fulfilment through his prison reading. He realised that his ordeal had filled his soul with the fruit of experience, however bitter it tasted at the time.
<blockquote> ... I wanted to eat of the fruit of all the trees in the garden of the world ... And so, indeed, I went out, and so I lived. My only mistake was that I confined myself so exclusively to the trees of what seemed to me the sun-lit side of the garden, and shunned the other side for its shadow and its gloom.{{sfn|Holland|Hart-Davis|2000|p=739}}
</blockquote>

Wilde was released from prison on 19 May 1897{{sfn|Ellmann|1988|p=[https://archive.org/details/oscarwilde00ellm/page/527 527]}} and sailed that evening for [[Dieppe]], France.{{sfn|Ellmann|1988|p=528}} He never returned to the United Kingdom.

On his release, he gave the manuscript to Ross, who may or may not have carried out Wilde's instructions to send a copy to Douglas (who later denied having received it). The letter was partially published in 1905 as ''[[De Profundis (letter)|De Profundis]]''; its complete and correct publication first occurred in 1962 in ''[[The Letters of Oscar Wilde]]''.{{efn|Ross published a version of the letter expurgated of all references to Douglas in 1905 with the title ''De Profundis'', expanding it slightly for an edition of Wilde's collected works in 1908, and then donated it to the [[British Museum]] on the understanding that it would not be made public until 1960. In 1949, Wilde's son [[Vyvyan Holland]] published it again, including parts formerly omitted, but relying on a faulty typescript bequeathed to him by Ross. Ross's typescript had contained several hundred errors, including typist's mistakes, Ross's "improvements" and other inexplicable omissions.{{sfn|Holland|Hart-Davis|2000|p=683}}}}

[[File:Oscar Wilde's visiting card (as Sebastian Melmoth).jpg|thumb|Oscar Wilde's [[visiting card]] after his release from gaol]]
Though Wilde's health had suffered greatly from the harshness and diet of prison, he had a feeling of spiritual renewal. He immediately wrote to the [[Society of Jesus]] requesting a six-month Catholic retreat; when the request was denied, Wilde wept.{{sfn|Holland|Hart-Davis|2000|pp=841-842}} "I intend to be received into the Catholic Church before long", Wilde told a journalist who asked about his religious intentions.<ref>Pearce, Joseph [https://books.google.com/books?id=TedJfEcWpokC The Picture of Dorian Gray (Introduction)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160508171715/https://books.google.com/books?id=TedJfEcWpokC&dq |date=8 May 2016}}, p.&nbsp;X, Ignatius Press, 2008.</ref>

He spent his last three years impoverished and in exile. He took the name "Sebastian Melmoth", after [[Saint Sebastian]] and the titular character of ''[[Melmoth the Wanderer]]'' (a [[Gothic fiction|Gothic novel]] by [[Charles Maturin]], Wilde's great-uncle).{{sfn|Holland|Hart-Davis|2000|p=842}} Wilde wrote two long letters to the editor of the ''[[Daily Chronicle (United Kingdom)|Daily Chronicle]]'', describing the brutal conditions of English prisons and advocating [[penal reform]]. His discussion of the dismissal of Warder Martin for giving biscuits to an anaemic child prisoner repeated the themes of the corruption and degeneration of punishment that he had earlier outlined in ''[[The Soul of Man under Socialism]]''.{{sfn|Holland|Hart-Davis|2000|pp=847–855}}

Wilde spent mid-1897 with Robert Ross in the seaside village of [[Berneval-le-Grand]] in northern France, where he wrote ''The Ballad of Reading Gaol'', narrating the execution of [[Charles Thomas Wooldridge]], who murdered his wife in a rage at her infidelity. It moves from an objective story-telling to symbolic identification with the prisoners.{{sfn|Sandulescu|1994|p=308}} No attempt is made to assess the justice of the laws which convicted them but rather the poem highlights the brutality of the punishment that all convicts share. Wilde juxtaposes the executed man and himself with the line "Yet each man kills the thing he loves".{{sfn|Sandulescu|1994|p=310}} He adopted the proletarian ballad form and the author was credited as "C33", Wilde's cell number in Reading Gaol. He suggested that it be published in ''Reynolds' Magazine'', "because it circulates widely among the criminal classes&nbsp;– to which I now belong&nbsp;– for once I will be read by my peers&nbsp;– a new experience for me".{{sfn|Kiberd|2000|p=336}} It was an immediate roaring commercial success, going through seven editions in less than two years, only after which "[Oscar Wilde]" was added to the title page, though many in literary circles had known Wilde to be the author.{{sfn|Mason|1972|pp=408-410}}{{sfn|Ellmann|1988|p=526}}

Although Douglas had been the cause of his misfortunes, he and Wilde were reunited in August 1897 at [[Rouen]]. This meeting was disapproved of by the friends and families of both men. Constance Wilde was already refusing to meet Wilde or allow him to see their sons, though she sent him money – three pounds a week. During the latter part of 1897, Wilde and Douglas lived together near [[Naples]] for a few months until they were separated by their families under the threat of cutting off all funds.{{sfn|Hyde|1948|p=308}}

Wilde's final address was at the dingy Hôtel d'Alsace (now known as [[L'Hôtel]]), on rue des Beaux-Arts in [[Saint-Germain-des-Prés]], Paris. "This poverty really breaks one's heart: it is so ''sale'' [filthy], so utterly depressing, so hopeless. Pray do what you can" he wrote to his publisher.{{sfn|Holland|Hart-Davis|2000|p=1092}} He corrected and published ''[[An Ideal Husband]]'' and ''[[The Importance of Being Earnest]]'', the proofs of which, according to Ellmann, show a man "very much in command of himself and of the play" but he refused to write anything else: "I can write, but have lost the joy of writing".{{sfn|Ellmann|1988|p=527}}

He wandered the boulevards alone and spent what little money he had on alcohol.{{sfn|Ellmann|1988|p=528}} A series of embarrassing chance encounters with hostile English visitors, or Frenchmen he had known in better days, drowned his spirit. Soon Wilde was sufficiently confined to his hotel to joke, on one of his final trips outside, "My [[wallpaper]] and I are fighting a duel to the death. One of us has got to go".{{sfn|Ellmann|1988|p=546}} On 12 October 1900 he sent a telegram to Ross: "Terribly weak. Please come".{{sfn|Holland|Hart-Davis|2000|p=1119}} His moods fluctuated; [[Max Beerbohm]] relates how their mutual friend [[Reginald Turner|Reginald 'Reggie' Turner]] had found Wilde very depressed after a nightmare. "I dreamt that I had died, and was supping with the dead!" "I am sure", Turner replied, "that you must have been the life and soul of the party."<ref>M. Beerbohm (1946), "Mainly on the Air"</ref>{{sfn|Holland|Hart-Davis|2000|p=1213}}

=== Death ===
[[File:Oscar Wilde on his Deathbed 1900 by Maurice Gilbert.jpg|thumb|right|Oscar Wilde on his deathbed in 1900. Photograph by Maurice Gilbert.]]
By 25 November 1900, Wilde had developed [[meningitis]], then called "cerebral meningitis". Robbie Ross arrived on 29 November, sent for a priest, and Wilde was [[Conditional baptism|conditionally baptised]] into the Catholic Church by Fr Cuthbert Dunne, a [[Passionists|Passionist]] priest from Dublin,{{sfn|Holland|Hart-Davis|2000|p=1224}}<ref>Cavill, Paul, Heather Ward, Matthew Baynham, and Andrew Swinford, [https://books.google.com/books?id=X2HG2SyNkaoC The Christian tradition in English literature: poetry, plays, and shorter prose] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160516172554/https://books.google.com/books?id=X2HG2SyNkaoC&dq |date=16 May 2016}}, p.&nbsp;337, Zondervan 2007.</ref> Wilde having been baptised in the [[Church of Ireland]] and having moreover a recollection of Catholic baptism as a child, a fact later attested to by the minister of the sacrament, Fr Lawrence Fox.<ref>Pearce, Joseph, [https://books.google.com/books?id=OGAUvLHnBAsC The unmasking of Oscar Wilde] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160507151813/https://books.google.com/books?id=OGAUvLHnBAsC&pg |date=7 May 2016}}, pp.&nbsp;28–29, Ignatius Press, 2004</ref> Fr Dunne recorded the baptism:

<blockquote> As the ''voiture'' rolled through the dark streets that wintry night, the sad story of Oscar Wilde was in part repeated to me... Robert Ross knelt by the bedside, assisting me as best he could while I administered conditional baptism, and afterwards answering the responses while I gave [[Anointing of the Sick (Catholic Church)|Extreme Unction]] to the prostrate man and recited the prayers for the dying. As the man was in a semi-comatose condition, I did not venture to administer the [[Holy Viaticum]]; still I must add that he could be roused and was roused from this state in my presence. When roused, he gave signs of being inwardly conscious... Indeed I was fully satisfied that he understood me when told that I was about to receive him into the Catholic Church and gave him the [[Last rites|Last Sacraments]]... And when I repeated close to his ear the Holy Names, the [[Act of Contrition|Acts of Contrition]], Faith, Hope and Charity, with acts of humble resignation to the Will of God, he tried all through to say the words after me.{{sfn|Holland|Hart-Davis|2000|p=1223}}{{efn|Robert Ross, in his letter to [[More Adey]] (dated 14 December 1900), described a similar scene: "(Wilde) was conscious that people were in the room, and raised his hand when I asked him whether he understood. He pressed our hands. I then went in search of a priest and with great difficulty found Fr Cuthbert Dunne, of the Passionists, who came with me at once and administered Baptism and [[Anointing of the Sick (Catholic Church)|Extreme Unction]] – Oscar could not take the [[Eucharist]]".{{sfn|Holland|Hart-Davis|2000|pp=1219–1220}}}}</blockquote>

There are a few flowers beside a small plaque at the base. The tomb is surrounded by a protective glass barrier that is covered with graffiti.|The tomb of Oscar Wilde (surrounded by glass barrier) in [[Père Lachaise Cemetery]]]]

Wilde was initially buried in the [[Cimetière de Bagneux]] outside Paris; in 1909 his remains were disinterred and transferred to [[Père Lachaise Cemetery]], inside the city.{{sfn|Holland|Hart-Davis|2000|p=1230}} [[Oscar Wilde's tomb|His tomb]] there was designed by Sir [[Jacob Epstein]].{{efn|Epstein produced the design with architect [[Charles Holden]], for whom Epstein produced several controversial commissions in London.}} It was commissioned by Robert Ross, who asked for a small compartment to be made for his own ashes, which were duly transferred in 1950. The modernist angel depicted as a relief on the tomb was originally complete with male genitalia, which were initially censored by French authorities with a golden leaf. The genitals have since been vandalised; their current whereabouts are unknown. In 2000, Leon Johnson, a multimedia artist, installed a silver prosthesis to replace them.<ref>{{cite web |last=Johnson |first=Leon |year=2000 |title=(Re)membering Wilde |url=http://www.leonjohnson.org/projects/wilde.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021073735/http://www.leonjohnson.org/projects/wilde.html |archive-date=21 October 2014 |access-date=24 July 2015}}</ref> In 2011, the tomb was cleaned of the many lipstick marks left there by admirers and a glass barrier was installed to prevent further marks or damage.<ref>{{cite news |last=Tagliabue |first=John |date=2011-12-16 |title=Walling Off Oscar Wilde's Tomb From Admirers' Kisses |language=en-US |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/16/world/europe/oscar-wildes-tomb-sealed-from-admirers-kisses.html |url-access=limited |access-date=2023-02-01 |issn=0362-4331 |id={{ProQuest|1620500886}}}}</ref>

For his mourners will be outcast men,
And outcasts always mourn.{{sfn|Ellmann|1988|p=553}}

=== Posthumous pardon ===
In 2017, Wilde was among an estimated 50,000 men who were pardoned for homosexual acts that were no longer considered offences under the [[Policing and Crime Act 2017]] (homosexuality was [[Sexual Offences Act 1967|decriminalised in England and Wales in 1967]]).

Wilde's life has been the subject of numerous biographies since his death. The earliest were memoirs by those who knew him: often they are personal or impressionistic accounts which can be good character sketches, but are sometimes factually unreliable.{{sfn|Raby|1997|pp=6, 10}} [[Frank Harris]], his friend and editor, wrote a biography, ''Oscar Wilde: His Life and Confessions'' (1916); though prone to exaggeration and sometimes factually inaccurate, it offers a good literary portrait of Wilde.{{sfn|Raby|1997|p=9}} [[Lord Alfred Douglas]] wrote two books about his relationship with Wilde. ''Oscar Wilde and Myself'' (1914), largely ghost-written by [[T. W. H. Crosland]], vindictively reacted to Douglas's discovery that ''De Profundis'' was addressed to him and defensively tried to distance him from Wilde's scandalous reputation. Both authors later regretted their work.{{sfn|Raby|1997|p=8}} Later, in ''Oscar Wilde: A Summing Up'' (1939) and his ''Autobiography'', Douglas was more sympathetic to Wilde. Of Wilde's other close friends, [[Robert Sherard]]; [[Robbie Ross|Robert Ross]], his literary executor; and [[Charles Ricketts]] variously published biographies, reminiscences or correspondence. The first more or less objective biography of Wilde came about when [[Hesketh Pearson]] wrote ''Oscar Wilde: His Life and Wit'' (1946).{{sfn|Raby|1997|p=5}} In 1954 Wilde's son [[Vyvyan Holland]] published his memoir ''Son of Oscar Wilde'', which recounts the difficulties Wilde's wife and children faced after his imprisonment.<ref>{{cite magazine |date=27 September 1954 |title=Great Britain: A Life of Concealment |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,820321-1,00.html |url-status=dead |magazine=Time |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090212185348/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,820321-1,00.html |archive-date=12 February 2009 |access-date=22 February 2010}}</ref> It was revised and updated by [[Merlin Holland]] in 1989.

''Oscar Wilde, a critical study'' by [[Arthur Ransome]] was published in 1912. The book only briefly mentioned Wilde's life, but subsequently Ransome (and The Times Book Club) were sued for libel by Lord Alfred Douglas. At the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] in London in April 1913, Douglas lost the libel action after a reading of ''[[De Profundis (letter)|De Profundis]]'' refuted his claims.<ref>''The Autobiography of Arthur Ransome'', pp.&nbsp;146–154 (1976, Jonathan Cape, London) {{ISBN|0-224-01245-2}}.</ref><ref>''The Last Englishman'' by Roland Chambers pp 61–69 (2009, Faber and Faber, London) {{ISBN|978-0-571-22261-2}}.</ref>
