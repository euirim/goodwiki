An eight-time [[List of multiple Olympic gold medalists|Olympic gold medallist]], Bolt is the only sprinter to win [[100 metres at the Olympics|Olympic 100 m]] and [[200 metres at the Olympics|200&nbsp;m]] titles at three consecutive Olympics (2008, 2012, and 2016). He also won two 4 × 100 relay gold medals. He gained worldwide fame for his double sprint victory in world record times at the [[2008 Summer Olympics|2008 Beijing Olympics]], which made him the first person to hold both records since [[fully automatic time]] became mandatory.

An eleven-time [[World Championships in Athletics|World Champion]], he won consecutive [[100 metres at the World Championships in Athletics|World Championship 100&nbsp;m]], [[200 metres at the World Championships in Athletics|200&nbsp;m]] and [[4 × 100 metres relay at the World Championships in Athletics|4 × 100 metres relay]] gold medals from 2009 to 2015, with the exception of a 100&nbsp;m [[false start]] in 2011. He is the [[IAAF World Championships in Athletics#Multiple medallist|most successful male athlete]] of the World Championships. Bolt is the first athlete to win four World Championship titles in the 200&nbsp;m and is one of the most successful in the 100&nbsp;m with three titles, being the first person to run sub-9.7s and sub-9.6s.

Bolt improved upon his second [[Men's 100 metres world record progression|100&nbsp;m world record]] of 9.69 with 9.58 seconds in 2009 – the biggest improvement since the start of electronic timing. He has twice broken the [[Men's 200 metres world record progression|200 metres world record]], setting 19.30 in 2008 and 19.19 in 2009. He has helped Jamaica to three [[Men's 4 × 100 metres relay world record progression|4 × 100 metres relay world records]], with the current record being 36.84 seconds set in 2012. Bolt's most successful event is the 200 m, with three Olympic and four World titles. The 2008 Olympics was his international debut over 100&nbsp;m; he had earlier won numerous 200&nbsp;m medals (including [[2007 World Championships in Athletics|2007 World Championship]] silver) and held the [[List of world junior records in athletics|world under-20]] and [[List of world youth bests in athletics|world under-18 records]] for the event until being surpassed by [[Erriyon Knighton]] in 2021.

His achievements as a sprinter have earned him the media nickname "Lightning Bolt", and his awards include the [[IAAF World Athlete of the Year]], [[Track & Field Athlete of the Year]], [[BBC Overseas Sports Personality of the Year]] (three times), and [[Laureus World Sports Award for Sportsman of the Year|Laureus World Sportsman of the Year]] (four times).

Bolt is one of only nine athletes (along with [[Valerie Adams]], [[Veronica Campbell-Brown]], [[Jacques Freitag]], [[Yelena Isinbayeva]], [[Jana Pittman]], [[Dani Samuels]], [[David Storl]], and [[Kirani James]]) to win world championships at the youth, junior, and senior level of an athletic event.

===2016 Rio Olympics===
[[File:De Grasse and Bolt Rio 100m final 2016.jpg|thumb|[[Andre De Grasse]] and Bolt after running the 100 m final at the 2016 Olympics]]

Bolt competed sparingly in the 200&nbsp;m before the Olympics, with a run of 19.89 seconds to win at the [[London Grand Prix]] being his sole run of note over that distance. He had four races over 100&nbsp;m, though only one was in Europe, and his best of 9.88 seconds in Kingston placed him fourth on the world seasonal rankings. As in the previous season, Gatlin appeared to be in better form, having seasonal bests of 9.80 and 19.75 seconds to rank first and second in the sprints.<ref>[https://www.iaaf.org/records/toplists/sprints/100-metres/outdoor/men/senior/2016 senior outdoor 2016 100 Metres men] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161201215936/https://www.iaaf.org/records/toplists/sprints/100-metres/outdoor/men/senior/2016 |date=1 December 2016 }}.

He also highlighted his dislike of rival [[Tyson Gay]]'s reduced ban for cooperation, given their close rivalry since the start of Bolt's career, saying "it really bothered me – really, really bothered me".<ref>Brown, Mick (15 July 2016).

Bolt took a financial stake in a new Australia-based track and field meeting series – [[Nitro Athletics]]. He performed at the inaugural meet in February 2017 and led his team (Bolt All-Stars) to victory. The competition featured variations on traditional track and field events. He committed himself to three further editions.<ref>[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/inquirer/nitro-goes-off-with-a-bang-returning-crowds-to-athletics/news-story/7fc26c3809c14300385e8a0fc14bcbf8 Nitro goes off with a bang, returning crowds to athletics].

In 2017, the Jamaican team was stripped of the 2008 Olympics 4×100 metre title due to [[Nesta Carter]]'s disqualification for doping offences. Bolt, who never failed a dope test, was quoted by the BBC saying that the prospect of having to return the gold was "heartbreaking".<ref name=BBCJan17>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/athletics/38744846|title=Usain Bolt loses one Olympic gold medal as Nesta Carter tests positive|date=25 January 2017|work=BBC News|access-date=25 January 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170125144538/http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/athletics/38744846|archive-date=25 January 2017}}</ref> The banned substance in Carter's test was identified as [[methylhexanamine]], a nasal decongestant sometimes used in dietary supplements.

At the [[2017 World Athletics Championships]], Bolt won his heat uncomfortably after a slow start in 10.07, in his semi-final he improved to 9.98 but was beaten by [[Christian Coleman]] by 0.01. That race broke Bolt's 4 year winning streak in the 100&nbsp;m. In his final individual race, in the final, Bolt won the bronze medal in 9.95, 0.01 behind silver medalist Coleman and 0.03 behind World Champion [[Justin Gatlin]]. It was the first time Bolt had been beaten at a major championship since the 4×100 m relay of the [[2007 World Athletics Championships]]. Also at the 2017 World Athletics Championships, Bolt participated as the anchor runner for Jamaica's 4×100-metre relay team in both the heats and the final. Jamaica won their heat comfortably in 37.95 seconds. In what was intended to be his final race, Bolt pulled up in agony with 50 metres to go and collapsed to the track after what was later confirmed to be another [[hamstring injury]]. He refused a wheelchair and crossed the finish line one last time with the assistance of his teammates [[Omar McLeod]], [[Julian Forte]], and [[Yohan Blake]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/olympics/story/_/id/20324713/usain-bolt-injured-final-race-career-great-britain-wins-4x100-final|title=Bolt finale ends in injury and collapse, no gold|work=ESPN.com|access-date=13 August 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170813050749/http://www.espn.com/olympics/story/_/id/20324713/usain-bolt-injured-final-race-career-great-britain-wins-4x100-final|archive-date=13 August 2017}}</ref>

He popularised the "lightning bolt" pose, also known as "to di world" or "bolting", which he used both before races and in celebration. The pose consists of extending a slightly raised left arm to the side and the right arm folded across the chest, with both hands have the thumb and [[index finger]] outstretched. His performance of the pose during his Olympic and World Championship victories led to widespread copying of the move, from American President [[Barack Obama]] to small children. It has been suggested that the pose comes from Jamaican [[dancehall]] moves of the period,<ref>[https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/rio-2016/2016/08/14/origin-usain-bolt-to-the-world-rio-olympics-2016/88728420/ What's the origin of Usain Bolt's signature celebration?].

=== Financial crisis ===
Usain Bolt had fallen victim to a fraud scheme, resulting in the disappearance of more than $12 million from his retirement savings account, according to a letter from his attorneys obtained by the Associated Press. The account, held with Kingston-based investment firm Stocks and Securities Ltd., showed a balance of only $12,000, down from its previous $12.8 million.
